# LLMOps — Eval · Guardrails · Prompt Versioning · Cost/Latency
> MLOps adapted to LLM applications, where the "model" is often a frozen API and the system you operate is
> prompts + retrieval + tools. What changes: evaluation is open-ended (LLM-as-judge, rubrics, no single
> accuracy number), **prompts are versioned artifacts**, guardrails defend inputs/outputs (prompt injection,
> PII, toxicity, hallucination), and cost/latency per token become first-class operational metrics.

**Why it matters:** the fastest-growing interview area. Expect "how is LLMOps different from MLOps?" —
the answers: evaluation without ground truth (offline evals + LLM-as-judge + online feedback), prompt
versioning and regression testing, guardrails as the production safety layer, and managing token cost +
latency. Builds on LLM internals (covered in LLMs, Applications and Agents) but focuses on *operating* LLM systems.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the landscape** — read [Building LLM Applications for Production](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html) and watch [the companion talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spamOhG7BOA). *The canonical map of what LLMOps must handle.*
2. **Define LLMOps** — read [What is LLMOps?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/llmops). *Where it overlaps with and diverges from MLOps.*
3. **Evaluate LLMs** — browse [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals) and watch the [Google Cloud LLMOps course intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabmG21y290). *Eval harnesses, LLM-as-judge, regression testing for prompts.*
4. **Add guardrails** — watch [Combining Guardrails and LLM Evaluations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXdBwgVZ_Ho). *Input/output filters: prompt injection, PII, toxicity, format checks.*
5. **Trace & monitor in prod** — read [LangSmith docs](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) and watch [LLM Evals & Guardrails in Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=041gk0N8gPA). *Tracing, online evals, and feedback loops.*
