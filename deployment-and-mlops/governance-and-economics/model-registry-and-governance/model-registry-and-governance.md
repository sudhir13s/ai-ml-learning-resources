# Model Registry & Governance
> A central, versioned store for trained models with stage transitions (staging → production → archived),
> lineage, approvals, and metadata. Governance adds the controls around it: who can promote a model, what
> documentation it carries (model cards), audit trails, and compliance. The control plane between "trained"
> and "deployed."

**Why it matters:** "how do you manage which model version is in production, and roll back?" Interviewers
want the registry's role (single source of truth, stage transitions, lineage back to the run + data),
how it gates deployment (approvals, quality checks), and governance/responsible-AI concerns (model cards,
auditability, access control). Sits between experiment tracking and serving.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the registry concept** — read [MLflow Model Registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/model-registry/). *Registered models, versions, stages, lineage — the core data model.*
2. **See the workflow** — watch [MLflow Model Registry: Staging vs Production vs Archived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aWL-c8ybm0). *Stage transitions and promotion — the deployment gate.*
3. **Do it hands-on** — watch [MLFlow Tutorial: Model Versioning & Registry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIiPo4qv97o). *Registering, versioning, and promoting a model in code.*
4. **Add governance** — read [Model Cards (paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and [Model Card Toolkit](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about). *Documentation, intended use, and limitations — the governance layer.*
5. **Production-readiness rubric** — read [The ML Test Score](https://research.google/pubs/the-ml-test-score-a-rubric-for-ml-production-readiness-and-technical-debt-reduction/). *The checklist a governance process should enforce before promotion.*
