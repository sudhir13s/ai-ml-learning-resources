# Cost Optimization for ML Systems
> Delivering the required quality and latency at the lowest sustainable cost. The levers: right-size and
> share GPUs, batch requests, autoscale to demand (and scale to zero), use spot/preemptible capacity for
> training, cache and quantize for inference, and pick batch over online when latency allows. Compute is
> often the dominant line item — and the one engineers control most directly.

**Why it matters:** the "your inference bill is exploding — how do you cut it without hurting users?"
question, increasingly central for LLM systems. Interviewers want the cost drivers (GPU-hours, idle
capacity, token volume), the trade-offs (latency vs throughput vs cost vs quality), and concrete levers:
batching, autoscaling/scale-to-zero, spot instances, quantization, caching, and batch vs online. Ties
together serving, scaling, and LLMOps.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Find the cost drivers** — read [Cost-Effective Machine Learning with Ray](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/cost-effective-machine-learning-with-ray). *Idle GPUs, over-provisioning, and where the money actually goes.*
2. **Lever 1 — batch vs online** — re-read [Static vs Dynamic Inference](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/production-ml-systems/static-vs-dynamic-inference). *Batch is dramatically cheaper when latency permits.*
3. **Lever 2 — autoscaling & sharing** — read [Ray Serve Autoscaling](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/autoscaling-guide.html). *Scale to demand (and to zero); pack/share GPUs to raise utilization.*
4. **Lever 3 — cheaper inference** — watch [Enabling Cost-Efficient LLM Serving with Ray Serve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ5K1CO9Wbs). *Batching + quantization + right-sized hardware on real LLM workloads.*
5. **LLM-specific economics** — read [Building LLM Applications for Production](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html) (cost/latency section). *Token cost, caching, model-size trade-offs for LLM systems.*
