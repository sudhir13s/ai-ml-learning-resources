# MLOps & Deployment
> Getting models into production and keeping them healthy — serving, pipelines, CI/CD,
> monitoring, and the systems discipline around ML.

**⭐ Start here:** [Made With ML](https://madewithml.com/) — **Goku Mohandas** — the best free, end-to-end MLOps course (design → develop → deploy → iterate).

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) — a short guided learning
path plus the best **free, open** courses, videos, papers, articles, and books for that topic.
> **✅ ready · ⬜ coming soon.** New here? Start with the field overview above, then work top to bottom.
