# Data & Concept Drift Detection
> Detecting when the world has moved away from the training distribution. **Data drift**: P(X) changes
> (inputs shift). **Concept drift**: P(Y|X) changes (the input→output relationship shifts). Both quietly
> erode accuracy — drift detection tells you *when to retrain* before users notice.

**Why it matters:** the deep-dive that follows monitoring, and a strong differentiator. Interviewers
want a crisp **data drift vs concept drift** distinction, detection methods (KS test, PSI, Chi-square,
Jensen–Shannon / Wasserstein distance), the **delayed-/no-label problem** (use prediction drift + input
drift as proxies), and the response (alert → root-cause → retrain). The trigger for continuous training.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Nail the definitions** — read [Evidently: What is Data Drift](https://www.evidentlyai.com/ml-in-production/data-drift) and [What is Concept Drift](https://www.evidentlyai.com/ml-in-production/concept-drift). *P(X) vs P(Y|X) — get this distinction exactly right.*
2. **Learn the tests** — read [Evidently: Data Drift Detection Deep Dive](https://learn.evidentlyai.com/ml-observability-course/module-2-ml-monitoring-metrics/data-drift-deep-dive). *KS, PSI, Chi-square, JS/Wasserstein — which test for which data type.*
3. **Detect it in code** — watch [Detect Data Drift Using Evidently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXu4NRG5WQU) and [Evidently in Jupyter: data & prediction drift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Z2e-IqmmU). *Running the tests and reading the reports.*
4. **Read the theory** — skim [A Survey on Concept Drift Adaptation](https://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/22491/). *Drift types (sudden/gradual/recurring) and adaptation strategies — the rigorous backbone.*
5. **Close the loop** — connect drift to retraining via [07 CI/CD for ML & CT](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deployment-and-mlops/release-and-deployment/cicd-for-ml-and-continuous-training/cicd-for-ml-and-continuous-training). *Drift detected → continuous-training pipeline fires.*
