# Model Monitoring & Observability
> Watching a deployed model so silent failures don't go unnoticed: operational health (latency, errors,
> throughput), data quality (schema, missing/out-of-range inputs), and model quality (accuracy when labels
> arrive, proxy metrics when they don't). Observability is being able to ask *why* it failed, not just *that* it did.

**Why it matters:** the "your model is live — how do you know it's still working?" question, and a near-universal
one. Models fail silently: no exception, just degrading predictions. Interviewers want the three layers
(operational / data / model quality), the **delayed-label problem** (and proxy metrics when ground truth is
late or absent), and the tool stack (Evidently, Prometheus, Grafana). Drift detection is the deep dive that follows.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the layers** — read [How to Monitor Machine Learning Models](https://christophergs.com/machine%20learning/2020/03/14/how-to-monitor-machine-learning-models/). *Operational vs data vs model-quality monitoring — the mental model.*
2. **Monitoring vs observability** — read [Evidently: What is ML Monitoring & Observability](https://learn.evidentlyai.com/ml-observability-course/module-1-introduction/ml-monitoring-observability). *Why "that it broke" (monitoring) and "why it broke" (observability) are different.*
3. **Build a dashboard** — work [Made With ML: Monitoring](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/monitoring/), then watch [Evidently AI: ML Monitoring & Observability Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgc3dSEAel0). *Turns the theory into a real metrics dashboard.*
4. **Batch vs online monitoring** — watch [Evidently: Batch architecture dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Mcu0hXfMA) and [Online architecture dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hTRXEOJF8k). *Two deployment shapes, two monitoring designs.*
5. **Go to drift** — move to [12 Data & Concept Drift Detection](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deployment-and-mlops/monitoring-and-reliability/data-and-concept-drift-detection/data-and-concept-drift-detection). *The statistical heart of why model quality degrades.*
