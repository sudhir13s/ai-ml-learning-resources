# Experiment Tracking — MLflow · Weights & Biases
> Logging every run's params, metrics, code version, and artifacts to a central store so experiments
> are comparable, searchable, and reproducible. The lab notebook of ML — turns "I think run 47 was
> best" into a queryable record.

**Why it matters:** a near-universal MLOps interview topic. Expect "how do you track experiments and
pick the best model," the anatomy of a run (params vs metrics vs tags vs artifacts), why this beats
spreadsheets/filenames, MLflow's four components (Tracking, Projects, Models, Registry), and how
tracking feeds the model registry and CI/CD downstream.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the mental model** — read [MLflow Tracking docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/). *Runs / experiments / params / metrics / artifacts — the vocabulary everything else uses.*
2. **Do it end-to-end** — follow [Made With ML: Experiment Tracking](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/experiment-tracking/). *Logs a real training loop and compares runs — the fastest path to fluency.*
3. **See a second tool** — watch [MLOps Zoomcamp: W&B Experiment Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNyqFMwEyL4). *W&B shows the hosted/collaborative flavor; comparing tools sharpens the "why."*
4. **Go deep on MLflow** — watch the [MLflow + Databricks full course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVskbekONlw). *Tracking → registry → deployment, the full lifecycle MLflow spans.*
5. **Wire into your workflow** — add tracking to a PyTorch loop with [W&B + PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KESSYZExK44). *Making logging a one-liner is what makes the habit stick.*
