# Reproducibility — Seeds, Environments & Lineage
> Being able to re-run a result and get the same model: pin the code, data, config, environment, and
> randomness so a run is a deterministic function of versioned inputs. The bedrock that experiment
> tracking, versioning, and CI/CD all stand on.

**Why it matters:** "your model trained great last month but you can't recreate it — what went wrong?"
Interviewers probe the full surface: random seeds and non-determinism (cuDNN, data shuffling), pinned
environments (Docker, lockfiles), data + code + config versioning, and lineage (which data + commit +
hyperparameters produced this artifact). The discipline that separates a demo from a system.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the problem** — watch [Joelle Pineau: Reproducible, Reusable, Robust ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVkViYY_fwA). *The reproducibility crisis framing that motivates every practice below.*
2. **Get the checklist** — read [CMU ML Blog: Reproducibility](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/5-reproducibility/) and the [ML Reproducibility Checklist (paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12206). *Concrete things to pin: code, data, environment, seeds, compute.*
3. **Separate the layers** — read [The Gradient: Independently Reproducible ML](https://thegradient.pub/independently-reproducible-machine-learning/). *Distinguishes "re-run my code" from "someone reproduces my result" — interviewers love this distinction.*
4. **Pin the environment** — read [Made With ML: Versioning](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/versioning/) and pin deps + data + model. *Turns the principles into code + DVC + a reproducible run.*
5. **Containerize it** — make the run a deterministic function of a pinned image; see [08 Model Packaging & Containerization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deployment-and-mlops/packaging-and-serving/model-packaging-and-containerization/model-packaging-and-containerization). *Environment parity is the last reproducibility gap.*
