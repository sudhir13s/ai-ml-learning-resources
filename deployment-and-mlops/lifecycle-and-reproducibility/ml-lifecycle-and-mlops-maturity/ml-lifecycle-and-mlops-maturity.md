# ML Lifecycle & MLOps Maturity
> The end-to-end loop a model lives in — scope → data → train → evaluate → deploy → monitor →
> iterate — and the maturity ladder (manual → pipeline automation → CI/CD/CT) that measures how
> automated and reliable that loop is. The map every MLOps conversation hangs off.

**Why it matters:** the classic "walk me through how a model gets to production and stays healthy"
question. Interviewers want to hear the full lifecycle (not just training), where MLOps differs from
DevOps (data + model are versioned artifacts, models silently decay), and Google's three maturity
levels — so you can place any tool or practice on the map.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the loop** — read [Made With ML — MLOps overview](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/) and the [ml-ops.org end-to-end workflow](https://ml-ops.org/content/end-to-end-ml-workflow). *Anchors the lifecycle stages before any tooling.*
2. **Learn the maturity ladder** — read [Google: MLOps levels 0/1/2](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), then watch [MLOps Maturity Levels according to Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SdMSQbNPEI). *This 0→1→2 framing is the answer interviewers are listening for.*
3. **See why ML is different** — read the [Hidden Technical Debt in ML Systems](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf) paper. *The "CACE / pipeline jungle / config debt" vocabulary that explains why MLOps exists.*
4. **Internalize the rules** — skim [Google's Rules of ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml). *43 hard-won heuristics that show the lifecycle as practitioners actually run it.*
5. **Shift the mindset** — watch [Andrew Ng: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo). *Reframes "improve the loop" as "improve the data," which is where production gains live.*
