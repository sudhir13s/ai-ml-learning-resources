# ML Pipelines & Orchestration — Airflow · Kubeflow
> Turning an ad-hoc notebook into a reliable DAG of steps (ingest → validate → transform → train →
> evaluate → deploy) that an orchestrator schedules, retries, and monitors. The automation backbone of
> MLOps maturity level 1 — pipelines, not people, run the workflow.

**Why it matters:** the "how do you automate retraining / move from a notebook to a production pipeline?"
question. Expect the DAG model, idempotency and retries, why data pipelines differ from generic workflows
(data validation, lineage, caching), and the tool landscape: **Airflow** (general workflow scheduler) vs
**Kubeflow Pipelines** (Kubernetes-native, ML-specific) vs lighter options (Metaflow, Prefect).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the levels** — read [ml-ops.org: Three Levels of ML Software](https://ml-ops.org/content/three-levels-of-ml-software). *Why pipelines (not scripts) are what "automation" means in MLOps.*
2. **Learn the DAG model** — watch [Learn Apache Airflow in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5peQThvQmQk). *DAGs, tasks, scheduling, retries — the orchestration vocabulary.*
3. **See the ML-native option** — read [Kubeflow Pipelines Overview](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/overview/) and watch [Intro to Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AY8mmbR1o4). *Containerized, reusable ML components on Kubernetes.*
4. **Build a real pipeline** — work [Made With ML: Orchestration](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/orchestration/). *Wires data → train → evaluate into a runnable, scheduled DAG.*
5. **Compare tools** — watch [Orchestrating ML with Airflow, Kubeflow & Prefect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2kFomZJJAc). *The decision criteria interviewers expect you to weigh.*
