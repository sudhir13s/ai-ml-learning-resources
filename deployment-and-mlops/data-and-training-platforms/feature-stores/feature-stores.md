# Feature Stores — Feast
> A central system that computes, stores, and serves ML features for both training (offline, historical,
> point-in-time correct) and inference (online, low-latency) — guaranteeing the **same** feature logic
> in both. The fix for train/serve skew and duplicated feature pipelines across teams.

**Why it matters:** the "how do you stop training and serving from computing features differently?"
question. Interviewers want the offline vs online split, **point-in-time correctness** (no future
leakage in training labels), feature reuse/discovery across teams, and where a feature store sits in
the architecture. Feast is the canonical open-source example.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Understand the problem** — read [Feature Stores for ML](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/feature-stores/). *Train/serve skew and the offline/online duality — the "why" before any tool.*
2. **See the canonical design** — watch [Feature Store: The Beginner's Guide (+Feast)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0InBN_a4cQQ). *Architecture: offline store, online store, registry, materialization.*
3. **Build one** — follow [Feast Quickstart](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/quickstart). *Define features, materialize to the online store, and fetch for inference — point-in-time joins click here.*
4. **Put it in a pipeline** — work [Made With ML: Feature Store](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/feature-store/). *Connects the store to training + serving in a real MLOps flow.*
5. **Survey the landscape** — browse [featurestore.org](https://www.featurestore.org/). *Where managed/open options differ, and when a feature store is overkill.*
