# A/B Testing · Shadow & Canary Deployment
> Strategies for releasing a new model safely, because **offline metrics don't guarantee online wins**.
> **Shadow**: run the new model in parallel, serve nothing — measure risk-free. **Canary**: route a small
> % of live traffic to it, ramp up if healthy. **A/B test**: split traffic and measure the business metric
> that decides the winner. Test in production, without betting the whole house.

**Why it matters:** the "your offline AUC went up — how do you know it's actually better in prod, and how
do you roll it out without risk?" question. Interviewers want the shadow → canary → full-rollout ladder,
when to use each, and the A/B basics (split, primary metric, why offline ≠ online). The deployment
counterpart to monitoring. (The *statistics* of A/B tests live in 01. Foundations — link below.)

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the ladder** — read [CD4ML: progressive delivery section](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html) for how models are rolled out gradually. *Frames shadow/canary/A-B as one safety continuum.*
2. **Shadow first** — watch [Shadow Deployment Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NUshG4ahoU) and read [SageMaker Shadow Tests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/shadow-tests.html). *Test under real traffic with zero user risk.*
3. **Then canary** — read [Canary Release](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html). *The 1% → 20% → 100% ramp and what to watch during it.*
4. **Then A/B** — watch [A/B Testing & Canary Deployments for ML Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57HEs4l6_44). *Splitting traffic and choosing the decision metric.*
5. **Get the stats right** — for hypothesis tests, power, and CUPED, go to [01. Foundations](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/mathematical-foundations/readme). *MLOps owns the deployment mechanics; Foundations owns the experiment statistics.*
