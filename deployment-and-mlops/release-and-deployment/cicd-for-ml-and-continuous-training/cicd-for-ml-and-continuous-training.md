# CI/CD for ML & Continuous Training (CT)
> Extending DevOps CI/CD to ML, plus a third loop unique to ML — **Continuous Training**: pipelines that
> automatically retrain, validate, and redeploy models as new data arrives or performance drops. The jump
> from MLOps maturity level 1 to level 2.

**Why it matters:** the "what's different about CI/CD for ML vs software?" question. Interviewers want
the extra validations (data + model, not just code), what gets versioned and tested (data schemas,
feature logic, model quality gates), and the CT loop: trigger → retrain → evaluate against a baseline →
canary/deploy. Tools: GitHub Actions, CML, and pipeline orchestrators.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the levels** — re-read [Google: MLOps level 2 (CI/CD/CT)](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning). *Where CT plugs into the maturity model.*
2. **Get the principles** — read [Martin Fowler: Continuous Delivery for ML (CD4ML)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html). *The canonical CD4ML article — the vocabulary interviewers use.*
3. **See ML-specific CI** — watch [MLOps Tutorial #1: Intro to CI for ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgIDqAzfuA). *Why ML CI needs data + model checks, not just unit tests.*
4. **Automate model tracking in CI** — watch [MLOps Tutorial #3: Track ML models with Git & GitHub Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPncjKH6SPk). *Comparing model metrics across branches in a PR — the model quality gate.*
5. **Build the pipeline** — work [Made With ML: CI/CD](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/cicd/). *A complete GitHub Actions CI/CD/CT flow for an ML project.*
