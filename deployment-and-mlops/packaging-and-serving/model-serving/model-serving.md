# Model Serving — REST/gRPC · Batch vs Online · BentoML · Triton · TF-Serving
> Exposing a model so applications can get predictions: wrap it behind an API (REST or gRPC), or run it
> over a dataset in bulk. The choice — **online** (low-latency, per-request) vs **batch/offline**
> (high-throughput, scheduled) — and the runtime (BentoML, Triton, TF-Serving) shape your whole
> production architecture.

**Why it matters:** the single most common deployment question. Interviewers want the online vs batch
trade-off (latency vs throughput vs cost), REST vs gRPC, request batching, why purpose-built servers
(Triton, TF-Serving, BentoML) beat a hand-rolled Flask app, and the prediction-service contract
(versioning, warmup, health checks). The core of "how is your model actually used."

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the split** — read [Google: Static vs Dynamic (batch vs online) Inference](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/production-ml-systems/static-vs-dynamic-inference). *The first decision; everything else follows from it.*
2. **See the patterns** — read [Serving ML Models in Production: Common Patterns](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/serving-ml-models-in-production-common-patterns). *Pipeline, ensemble, online/offline — the vocabulary of serving architectures.*
3. **Build a REST service** — work [Made With ML: API](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/api/), then watch [Getting Started with BentoML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnceIPcWJyA). *Model → versioned REST endpoint in minutes.*
4. **See the deployment modes** — watch [MLOps Zoomcamp: Three Ways of Deploying a Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGe4yIoBRA). *Web service vs streaming vs batch, side by side.*
5. **Meet the high-perf servers** — skim [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) and [TF-Serving architecture](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/architecture). *Dynamic batching, multi-framework, GPU — why these exist.*
