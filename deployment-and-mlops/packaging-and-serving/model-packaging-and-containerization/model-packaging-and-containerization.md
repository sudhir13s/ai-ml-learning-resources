# Model Packaging & Containerization — Docker
> Bundling a model, its serving code, and every dependency into a portable, reproducible artifact —
> usually a Docker image — that runs identically on a laptop, in CI, and in production. The unit of
> deployment that makes "works on my machine" a non-problem.

**Why it matters:** "how do you ship a trained model to production?" Interviewers probe the artifact
(weights + code + env + interface), why containers solve dependency/parity problems, Dockerfile
fundamentals (layers, caching, slim/multi-stage builds, pinned base images), and ML-specific packaging
(model formats like ONNX/SavedModel, GPU images, image size). The bridge from "trained" to "served."

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Learn containers** — watch [Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAkwW2tuIqE) and read [Docker: Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). *Images, containers, Dockerfiles — the foundation.*
2. **Containerize a model** — watch [Convert your ML Model into a Docker Image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JigSpm6KORI). *Wrap a model + API into an image you can run anywhere.*
3. **Do it the MLOps way** — work [Made With ML: Docker](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/docker/). *Packaging within a real serving workflow, with a clean interface.*
4. **Build production images** — read [Docker: Dockerfile best practices](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/). *Layer caching, multi-stage builds, slim images — what separates a toy image from a deployable one.*
5. **Connect to serving** — move to [09 Model Serving](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deployment-and-mlops/packaging-and-serving/model-serving/model-serving). *The image is the artifact a serving runtime runs; packaging and serving are two halves of deployment.*
