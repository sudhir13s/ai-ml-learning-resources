# Scaling Inference — Autoscaling · GPU · Ray Serve
> Meeting variable demand without over-paying: horizontally scale replicas, autoscale on the right
> signal (queue depth / latency, not just CPU), pack and share GPUs, and batch requests to raise
> throughput. The systems layer that turns a single prediction service into one that survives traffic spikes.

**Why it matters:** the "your model gets 10× traffic at peak — how do you scale it cost-effectively?"
question. Interviewers want horizontal vs vertical scaling, the right autoscaling metric (queue depth /
concurrency beats CPU% for inference), GPU specifics (cold starts, sharing/MIG, batching for utilization),
and tools like Ray Serve + Kubernetes HPA. The bridge between serving and cost.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Frame the goal** — read [Considerations for Deploying ML Models in Production](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/considerations-for-deploying-machine-learning-models-in-production). *Throughput, latency, and cost as the scaling objective function.*
2. **Learn the autoscaling signal** — read [Ray Serve Autoscaling Guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/autoscaling-guide.html) and [Kubernetes Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/). *Why queue depth/concurrency is the right metric for inference, not CPU%.*
3. **See it in a framework** — read [Ray Serve docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) and watch [Introducing Ray Serve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV4YS4e1CXg). *Replicas, autoscaling, and batching in one programmable layer.*
4. **Scale on GPUs** — watch [Productionizing ML at Scale with Ray Serve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtH-CMpmxvI). *GPU packing, batching, and multi-model serving under load.*
5. **Connect to cost** — move to [16 Cost Optimization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deployment-and-mlops/governance-and-economics/cost-optimization/cost-optimization). *Autoscaling, batching, and GPU sharing are the main levers on the inference bill.*
