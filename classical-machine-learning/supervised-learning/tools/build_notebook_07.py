"""Generate the step-by-step teaching notebook (07-Decision-Trees.ipynb).

The notebook mirrors ``decision_trees.py`` one measurement at a time, so a learner can open it, run every
cell live, and *see* how a decision tree is grown on real data — the impurity functions, the information
gain of a worked split, the greedy best-split search, a tree grown from scratch, the verification against
scikit-learn, the learned-tree picture, the axis-aligned decision boundary, the overfitting depth sweep,
feature importance and its high-cardinality trap, and the regression-tree staircase. Each numbered step has
a short markdown lead-in (the intuition) followed by ONE focused code cell with real output. This generator
writes the .ipynb; a separate nbconvert pass executes it headless so the outputs are embedded.

    python build_notebook_07.py         # writes the .ipynb (unexecuted) into the chapter's code/
    python -m nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
        "../07-Decision-Trees/code/07-Decision-Trees.ipynb"

This generator lives in the domain-level ``03. Supervised_Learning/tools/`` folder; the notebook it writes
(and the module it mirrors) stay in the chapter's ``code/`` folder. Kept as a generator (not a hand-edited
.ipynb) so the notebook and the module stay in lockstep.

    "A decision tree is the machine-learning version of *20 Questions*: to classify a point it asks a "
    "series of simple `feature <= threshold?` questions and walks down the branches to a leaf. It **learns** "
    "which questions to ask, in what order, by greedily picking at each step the split that most reduces "
    "**impurity** (how mixed the labels are). The result is a model you can read as a flowchart — and the "
    "atom that random forests and gradient boosting are built from.\n"
    "\n"
    "This notebook builds that, one measurement at a time, on **real scikit-learn datasets** (no download): "
    "**Iris** (150 flowers) for the from-scratch tree and the boundary, **Breast Cancer** (569 tumours) for "
    "overfitting and importance, and **Diabetes** (442 patients) for the regression staircase. It is the "
    "executable companion to the chapter and to `decision_trees.py`; every function used here lives in that "
    "module, imported so the notebook and the module can never drift apart.\n"
    "\n"
    "By the end you will have **measured**, not just been told:\n"
    "\n"
    "1. what **Gini** and **entropy** compute (0 when pure, maximal at 50/50);\n"
    "2. a real **information-gain** split, by hand and in code (parent − weighted children);\n"
    "3. a decision tree **grown from scratch** and **verified** to match scikit-learn;\n"
    "4. the **overfitting curve** — train → 1.0 while validation plateaus — and the sweet-spot depth;\n"
    "5. why **MDI feature importance is fooled** by a high-cardinality noise column, and permutation is not;\n"
