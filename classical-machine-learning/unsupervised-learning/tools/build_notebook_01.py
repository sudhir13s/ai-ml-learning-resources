"""Generate the step-by-step teaching notebook (01-K-Means-Clustering.ipynb).

The notebook mirrors ``kmeans.py`` one measurement at a time, so a learner can open it, run every cell live,
and *see* how k-means works on real data — the inertia objective, the assign and update steps, why the mean
is the optimal centre, k-means++ seeding, Lloyd's loop with its monotone-decreasing inertia, the animation
of centroids migrating, the verification against scikit-learn on real Wine, the k-means++-vs-random init
distribution, choosing k by elbow + silhouette, and the two failure modes scored by ARI. Each numbered step
has a short markdown lead-in (the intuition) followed by ONE focused code cell with real output. This
generator writes the .ipynb; a separate nbconvert pass executes it headless so the outputs are embedded.

    python build_notebook_01.py         # writes the .ipynb (unexecuted) into the chapter's code/
    python -m nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
        "../01-K-Means-Clustering/code/01-K-Means-Clustering.ipynb"

This generator lives in the domain-level ``04. Unsupervised_Learning/tools/`` folder; the notebook it writes
(and the module it mirrors) stay in the chapter's ``code/`` folder. Kept as a generator (not a hand-edited
.ipynb) so the notebook and the module stay in lockstep.

    "\n"
    "You are handed a pile of points with **no labels** and asked to find the natural groups. K-means makes "
    "one decisive bet — *a good cluster is a compact round blob around a centre* — and turns it into a loop "
    "any child could run: **drop k flags, send each point to its nearest flag, slide each flag to the middle "
    "of the points that gathered around it, repeat until nothing moves.** That loop is **Lloyd's algorithm**, "
    "and it provably lowers a single objective (the within-cluster sum of squares) at every step.\n"
    "\n"
    "This notebook builds that, one measurement at a time, on **real scikit-learn data** (no download): "
    "**Wine** (178 wines, 13 chemical features, 3 cultivars), standardized, carries the load-bearing claims — "
    "the from-scratch/scikit-learn match, the init comparison, and the choice of *k*. A **controlled 2-D "
    "make_blobs** layout is used *only* to make Lloyd's iteration visible (you cannot watch centroids move in "
    "13 dimensions), and **two moons + sheared blobs** show the honest failure modes. Every function used "
    "here lives in `kmeans.py`, imported so the notebook and the module can never drift apart.\n"

    "4. **k-means++** beating random seeding as a measured distribution;\n"

    "| 1–3 | inertia; assign; update | J = Σ‖x−μ‖²; nearest-centre labels; the **mean** is the optimal centre |\n"
    "| 4–6 | k-means++; Lloyd's; the animation | spread seeds ∝ D²; **J falls monotonically** to convergence |\n"
    "| 7 | the Voronoi partition | straight boundaries, **convex** cells — the source of every failure mode |\n"
    "| 8 | verify vs scikit-learn (Wine) | **same inertia, ARI = 1.0** — the from-scratch loop is genuine |\n"
    "| 9 | k-means++ vs random (12 blobs) | k-means++ is **~2.5× tighter**; the advantage grows with k |\n"
    "| 10 | choosing k (Wine) | inertia **bends**, silhouette **peaks** — both at the true k=3 |\n"
    "| 11–12 | moons; anisotropic blobs | **low ARI** — straight cuts fail curved/sheared structure |\n"

    "**K-means partitions points by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares; Lloyd's algorithm "
    "alternates assign and update, each step provably lowering J, so it converges — to a *local* optimum "
    "(the global one is NP-hard), which k-means++ and restarts make a good one.** It assumes spherical, "
    "equal-size clusters — exactly the hard limit of a Gaussian mixture, and the reason the next chapters "
    "reach for **DBSCAN**, **GMMs**, and **spectral clustering**."
