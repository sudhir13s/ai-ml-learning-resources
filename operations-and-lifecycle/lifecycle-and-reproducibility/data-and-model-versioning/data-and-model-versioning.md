# Data & Model Versioning — DVC · lakeFS
> Git for data and models: track large datasets and model artifacts by content hash, store the bytes in
> object storage, and keep only lightweight pointers in Git — so any commit reconstructs the exact
> data + model that produced a result. Reproducibility's missing half (Git versions code, not 10 GB of data).

**Why it matters:** the "Git can't hold your training set — so how do you version data?" question.
Expect the DVC model (pointer files + remote cache + content-addressable storage), why this differs
from versioning code, data lineage (which dataset version → which model), and the difference between
file-level tools (DVC) and data-lake/branching tools (lakeFS). Pairs with experiment tracking for full reproducibility.

**Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the idea** — read [DVC: Get Started](https://dvc.org/doc/start) and watch [Versioning Data with DVC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLKBcPonMYw) — **DVCorg**. *The pointer-file + remote-cache model is the whole concept.*
2. **Version a real dataset** — follow [DVC: Data Management user guide](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/data-management). *`dvc add` / `dvc push` on a real dataset makes content-addressing concrete.*
3. **Tie data to models** — read [DVC: Versioning Data & Models scenario](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-models). *Switching dataset + model versions together is the lineage payoff.*
4. **Put it in a project** — follow [Made With ML: Versioning](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/versioning/). *Integrates DVC with code + experiment tracking for an end-to-end reproducible run.*
5. **See the data-lake approach** — read [lakeFS: Data Version Control](https://lakefs.io/data-version-control/). *Branch/commit/merge over object storage — the scale-out alternative to file-level DVC.*
