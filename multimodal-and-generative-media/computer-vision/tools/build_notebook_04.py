"""Generate the step-by-step teaching notebook (04-Image-Classification.ipynb).

The notebook mirrors ``image_classification.py`` one step at a time so a learner can open it, run every cell
live, and *see* the applied classification workflow being built and measured on real CIFAR-10 images: the
softmax + cross-entropy loss from scratch (verified against torch), the evaluation metrics from scratch
(top-1/top-5/confusion, cross-checked against scikit-learn), a real balanced data subset, the input pipeline,
a FROZEN pretrained ResNet-18 backbone used as a feature extractor, a linear probe trained on those features
(transfer learning), a from-scratch CNN at the same budget (transfer wins, measured), a data-augmentation
ablation (the overfitting gap shrinks), and an honest confusion matrix / per-class / prediction grid. Each
numbered step has a short markdown lead-in (the intuition) followed by a focused code cell with real output.

    python build_notebook_04.py         # writes the .ipynb (unexecuted) into the chapter's code/
    python -m nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
        "../04-Image-Classification/code/04-Image-Classification.ipynb"

This generator lives in the domain-level ``07. Computer Vision/tools/`` folder; the notebook it writes (and the
module it mirrors) stay in the chapter's ``code/`` folder. Kept as a generator (not a hand-edited .ipynb) so
the notebook and the module stay in lockstep.

    "Image classification assigns a whole image to one of $K$ labels. The naive attack — feed raw pixels to a "

    "The move that dominates applied vision is **transfer learning**: reuse the visual features a big model "
    "already learned on a huge dataset (ImageNet), and train only a small new head on your task. This notebook "

    "It uses the **exact same functions** as the companion page and its figures (imported from "
    "`image_classification.py`), so the numbers here are the numbers there. We build the loss and the metrics "
    "from scratch (checked against `torch` and `scikit-learn`), then: load a balanced real subset, freeze a "
    "pretrained **ResNet-18** backbone, train a **linear probe** on its features (transfer), compare against a "
    "**from-scratch CNN** at the same budget (transfer wins by a measured margin), ablate **augmentation** (the "
    "overfitting gap shrinks), and evaluate honestly with a confusion matrix, per-class accuracy, and a "

    "Image classification is a **workflow**, not a single model: real data → an input pipeline (resize + "
    "normalize + augment) → a **pretrained backbone** → a small **head** → softmax cross-entropy → honest "
    "evaluation. The dominant lesson is **transfer learning** — reusing ImageNet features beat training from "
    "scratch by a wide, measured margin at the same small budget, because low-level visual features are general. "
    "**Augmentation** regularizes (the overfitting gap roughly halved). And **accuracy hides failure**: the "
    "confusion matrix and per-class breakdown exposed the fine-grained animal confusions a single number "
    "concealed. Every quantity here was computed from a real run and cross-checked against `torch` / "
    "`scikit-learn`.\n"
