"""From-scratch decoding strategies: greedy, beam search, temperature, top-k, top-p (nucleus).

This is the ONE seeded source of truth for the chapter. The concept page, the teaching
notebook (17-Decoding-Strategies.ipynb), and the figure generator (make_figures_17.py) all
import the functions and constants below, so every quoted number -- joint probabilities,
beam scores, entropies, nucleus sizes, repetition rates -- is computed in exactly one place
and cannot silently drift between the prose, the notebook, and the figures.

It is the GENERAL sequence-generation view of decoding (beam search for closed-ended tasks
like machine translation / summarization + sampling for open-ended generation). The
LLM-systems angle (KV-cache interaction, speculative decoding throughput) lives in the
sibling chapter "Decoding and Sampling"; this file deliberately does not repeat
it.

What it demonstrates, all from tiny hand-built next-token distributions (no model download):
  * greedy = argmax per step (deterministic, locally optimal, globally MYOPIC);
  * beam search keeps the B best partial sequences and recovers a higher-JOINT-probability
    sequence that greedy misses (the AX-vs-BP trap), scored in numerically stable log-space;
  * length normalization removes beam's bias toward short sequences;
  * temperature reshapes the softmax (T<1 sharpens, T>1 flattens) -- measured via entropy;
  * top-k keeps a FIXED number of tokens; top-p (nucleus) keeps the smallest set whose
    cumulative prob >= p -- an ADAPTIVE cutoff that widens exactly when the model is uncertain;
  * neural text degeneration: a greedy/low-temperature loop on a self-reinforcing toy model
    collapses to a repeating token (low distinct-rate) while sampling stays diverse.

Every qualitative claim is asserted BEFORE it is printed, so running this file is a
self-check: if an assertion fails, a number on the page is wrong.

Pure NumPy so the numeric trace is fully deterministic and fast (well under a second on CPU);
no GPU and no model weights required. The reproducible trace in main() prints the host's
Python / NumPy versions honestly so the printed environment always matches where the numbers
were produced.

# (1) The two-step tree behind "greedy is myopic". After the prompt the model splits its mass
#     between first tokens A and B; the CONTINUATIONS differ in shape. Greedy takes the better
#     first token (A) but ends at AX; the genuinely most-probable sequence is BP, reachable
#     only by keeping the lower-probability first token B. This is the canonical beam example.

#      B=2 keeps {a, b} after step 1, then {ab: -0.9, ba: -1.0} after step 2 -- note ba beats aa
#      (-1.7) though 'a' was the better first token, because pruning is GLOBAL across expansions.
