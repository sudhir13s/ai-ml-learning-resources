"""From-scratch KV cache: prove identical outputs, then time how the speedup GROWS with length.

A single-layer attention runs the decode loop both ways -- recomputing K/V for every past
token (the O(n^2) trap) versus keeping a cache (O(n)) -- asserts the two produce identical
outputs to floating-point tolerance, then times them across growing sequence lengths so the
widening speedup is visible.

This is the same verified demo embedded in the concept page and the teaching notebook.
Verified on Python 3.12 / torch 2.x. Device-agnostic (CUDA / MPS / CPU); the absolute
milliseconds are device-dependent, but the identical-output check and the widening-speedup
trend hold on any device. The timing sweep in main() deliberately runs on CPU so the per-step math dominates and the widening trend stays clean.

Run:
    python kv_cache.py
