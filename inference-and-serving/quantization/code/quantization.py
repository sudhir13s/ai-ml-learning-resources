"""From-scratch LLM weight quantization: affine int8 (symmetric/asymmetric), the outlier
problem (per-tensor vs per-channel/group), and int4 group-wise — with reconstruction error
and the real memory math.

The whole landscape of LLM quantization rests on one formula: map a real value x to a small
integer q with q = round(x / s) + z and recover it with x_hat = s * (q - z). This script
implements that map from scratch, then shows the single fact that makes LLM quantization hard:
a few large-magnitude "outlier" channels wreck a per-tensor scale, and finer granularity
(per-channel, then per-group) is the fix. Finally it quantizes a weight matrix to int4 in
groups and prints the exact bytes saved vs fp16/int8 and the error paid for them.

Every claim is asserted before it is printed: dequant stays within the scale's quantization
bound, and per-channel error is strictly below per-tensor error once an outlier is present.

Verified on Python 3.12 / torch 2.x. Device-agnostic (CUDA / MPS / CPU); the math is identical
on any device, but the reproducible trace is pinned to CPU and the printed device line says so
honestly. No GPU needed — runs in well under a second.
