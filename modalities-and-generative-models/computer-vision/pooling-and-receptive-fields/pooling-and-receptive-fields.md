# Pooling & Receptive Fields
> **Pooling** downsamples a feature map (max or average over a window) to shrink spatial size, add a
> little translation invariance, and cut compute. The **receptive field** is the region of the input
> pixels that a single deep-layer activation actually "sees" — it grows with depth, kernel size, stride,
> and dilation. Together they explain how a CNN goes from local edges to whole-object reasoning.

**Why it matters:** a very common CNN interview thread — max vs average pooling, why modern nets often
replace pooling with strided convs, how to *compute* the receptive field of a layer, and the difference
between the theoretical and **effective** receptive field. You'll be asked to reason about output sizes
and "how much context does this neuron have?"

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See pooling in action** — watch [Pooling Layers (Andrew Ng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oOgPUO-TBY). *Max/average pooling, window, stride, and why it downsamples.*
2. **Build the mental model** — watch [Max Pooling Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjM_XQa5s6s) (deeplizard). *What pooling keeps and throws away, with feature-map visuals.*
3. **Understand receptive fields** — watch ⭐ [CNN Receptive Field (Deepia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip2HYPC_T9Q), then [Why 3×3 conv is best?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxpQZRvfnCc). *How depth and kernel size grow the field — the reason VGG stacks 3×3 convs.*
4. **Get the math** — read [CS231n: Convolutional Networks](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) (pooling + spatial arrangement). *Output-size and receptive-field arithmetic you'll be quizzed on.*
5. **Go rigorous** — read the ⭐ [Distill: Computing Receptive Fields](https://distill.pub/2019/computing-receptive-fields/). *Closed-form receptive-field math with interactive visuals.*
