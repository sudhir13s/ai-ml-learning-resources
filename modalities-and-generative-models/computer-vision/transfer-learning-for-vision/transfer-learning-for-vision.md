# Transfer Learning for Vision
> Instead of training a CNN from scratch, start from a backbone **pretrained on ImageNet** and adapt it
> to your task — either as a frozen **feature extractor** (replace only the head) or by **fine-tuning**
> (unfreeze some/all layers at a low learning rate). Early conv layers learn generic edges/textures that
> transfer everywhere; later layers are task-specific. This is how most real-world vision models get built.

**Why it matters:** an extremely common applied-ML interview topic — feature extraction vs fine-tuning,
which layers to freeze, how learning rates and dataset size drive the choice, why ImageNet features
transfer, and when transfer hurts (domain gap). It's also the practical answer to "how would you build
a classifier with only 500 labeled images?"

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch ⭐ [Transfer Learning (Andrew Ng, C3W2L07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yofjFQddwHE). *Why reusing pretrained features works and when to use it.*
2. **Feature extraction vs fine-tuning** — watch [Fine-tuning a Neural Network explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T-iXNNiwIs) (deeplizard). *The two regimes and how to choose between them.*
3. **Read the reference notes** — [CS231n: Transfer Learning](https://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/). *The decision table (dataset size × similarity) you'll be quizzed on.*
4. **Read the sources** — [How transferable are features?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792) + [CNN Features off-the-shelf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6382). *The empirical evidence for layer transferability.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run the [PyTorch Transfer Learning tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html). *Freeze a ResNet, swap the head, then fine-tune — end to end.*
