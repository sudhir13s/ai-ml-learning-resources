# Semantic Segmentation — FCN · U-Net · DeepLab
> Assign **every pixel** a class label (road, person, sky) — a dense, per-pixel classification. The key
> architecture is **encoder–decoder**: a CNN downsamples to capture context, then upsamples back to full
> resolution. **FCN** made it fully convolutional, **U-Net** added skip connections for sharp boundaries,
> and **DeepLab** used atrous (dilated) convolutions + CRFs to keep resolution without losing receptive field.

**Why it matters:** a core dense-prediction interview topic — why classification CNNs can't segment
directly, how transposed/upsampling convolutions and skip connections recover spatial detail, what atrous
convolution buys you (large receptive field, no downsampling), and the difference between semantic (no
instances) and instance segmentation. U-Net in particular is ubiquitous in medical imaging.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch ⭐ [U-Net clearly explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxcgx75k6yU) (TileStats). *The encoder–decoder + skip-connection idea, from scratch.*
2. **See the landscape** — watch [CS231n Lec 11: Detection & Segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDPWywWRIRo). *FCN, upsampling, and dense prediction in context.*
3. **Go deeper on architecture** — watch [Detection & Segmentation (Michigan, Lec 16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AyMR4IhSWQ). *A modern, thorough treatment of segmentation networks.*
4. **Read the sources** — [FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038) → [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) → [DeepLabv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587). *Fully convolutional → skip connections → atrous convolution.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work through [d2l: Semantic Segmentation](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/semantic-segmentation-and-dataset.html) + [transposed conv / FCN](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/fcn.html). *Build an FCN and see per-pixel predictions.*
