# Image Representation & Filtering — Edges · HOG · SIFT
> An image is a grid of pixel intensities (a function `I(x, y)`); **filtering** convolves it with a small
> kernel to smooth, sharpen, or measure gradients, and **hand-crafted features** (edges, HOG, SIFT)
> summarize those gradients into descriptors that are robust to lighting, scale, and small shifts.
> This is the pre-deep-learning vision pipeline — and the intuition every CNN feature map inherits.

**Why it matters:** before you can explain *why* a CNN's first layer learns edge detectors, you need to
know what Sobel/Canny edges, the HOG descriptor, and SIFT keypoints actually compute. Interviewers use
these to test whether you understand convolution, image gradients, scale/rotation invariance, and the
classical baselines (HOG + SVM for detection, SIFT for matching) that deep learning replaced.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See an image as a function** — watch [Computerphile: Finding the Edges (Sobel)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uihBwtPIBxM). *Grounds the whole topic: gradients = differences between neighboring pixels.*
2. **Learn filtering & convolution** — read [CS231n: Image Classification notes](https://cs231n.github.io/) intro + watch [Image Filtering, Convolution, Edge Detection (Shah)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7aGsfUxXL4). *Blur, sharpen, and gradient kernels are all the same operation.*
3. **Get edges right** — watch [Canny Edge Detector (Nayar)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUC1uoigH6s). *The canonical edge pipeline: gradient → non-max suppression → hysteresis.*
4. **Hand-crafted descriptors** — watch [HOG (UCF)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zib1YEE4LU) then [SIFT (UCF)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPcMS49V5hg), and read the ⭐ [SIFT paper](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf). *How gradients become scale/rotation-invariant features for detection and matching.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run the [OpenCV smoothing/filtering tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/d13/tutorial_py_filtering.html). *Implementing blur → Sobel → Canny on a real image cements it.*
