# Data Augmentation
> Synthetically expand a training set by applying label-preserving transforms — flips, crops, rotations,
> color jitter — plus modern mixing strategies like **Mixup**, **CutMix**, and **Cutout**, or learned
> policies like **AutoAugment / RandAugment**. Augmentation is the cheapest, most reliable regularizer
> in vision: it teaches invariances, fights overfitting, and is essential when labeled data is scarce.

**Why it matters:** a guaranteed practical question — name the standard transforms, explain *why*
augmentation regularizes (it enlarges the data manifold and enforces invariances), how Mixup/CutMix
differ from classic transforms, and which augmentations are safe for which task (e.g. don't vertical-flip
digits). It's also half the answer to "my model overfits — what do you do?"

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch ⭐ [Data Augmentation explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfM4DaLTkMs) (deeplizard). *What augmentation is and why it reduces overfitting.*
2. **See it in code** — watch [Data Augmentation with Keras API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSvpLUietIM) (deeplizard). *The standard transform pipeline applied to real images.*
3. **University treatment** — watch [Data Augmentation (DLFVC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmhnmTnI_8A) (Peter Wonka). *A more formal lecture covering the rationale and techniques.*
4. **Read the modern sources** — [Mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) → [Cutout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552) → [CutMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899) → [RandAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13719). *The mixing/policy methods that became default in strong baselines.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work through the [torchvision transforms](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) + [d2l: Image Augmentation](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/image-augmentation.html). *Build an augmentation pipeline and see the accuracy lift.*
