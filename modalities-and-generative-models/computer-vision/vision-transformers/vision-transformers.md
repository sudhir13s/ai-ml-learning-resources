# Vision Transformers (ViT)
> ViT applies the NLP transformer directly to images: split the image into fixed-size **patches**
> (e.g. 16×16), linearly embed each patch into a token, add positional encodings, prepend a `[CLS]`
> token, and run a standard transformer encoder. With enough data it matches or beats CNNs — trading
> the convolutional locality prior for global self-attention and scale.

**Why it matters:** the defining modern-vision question — how an image becomes a sequence of patch
tokens, why ViT needs large-scale pretraining (it lacks the CNN's built-in locality/translation
priors), how it compares to CNNs on data efficiency, and what hybrids (Swin, hierarchical windows)
add back. Expected for any role touching modern vision or multimodal models.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch ⭐ [Vision Transformers explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZMj1VKD9s) (Code With Aarohi). *Patches → tokens → transformer, the core idea.*
2. **Patchify in detail** — watch [ViT — An Image Is Worth 16×16 Words (Paper Explained)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8phM16htKbU) (Uygar Kurt). *Patch embedding, `[CLS]` token, and positional encodings.*
3. **Hear the original read** — watch [Yannic Kilcher: 16×16 Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4). *A critical paper read covering why scale matters.*
4. **Read the source** — the ⭐ [ViT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), then [Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030). *The pure transformer, then the hierarchical/windowed hybrid.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work through [d2l: Vision Transformer](https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/vision-transformer.html). *Implement patch embedding + encoder and classify.*
