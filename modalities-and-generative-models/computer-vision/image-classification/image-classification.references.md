# Image Classification — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Image Classification](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/image-classification/image-classification)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free / open (no paywall) and from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on the *applied classification workflow* (data, transfer learning, augmentation, evaluation), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame the task** — watch [CS231n Lecture 2: Image Classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUX-nOEjG0) (**Stanford**), then read the [CS231n classification notes](https://cs231n.github.io/classification/). *The data-driven paradigm, the nearest-neighbor baseline, and why we need learned features.*
2. **Get the loss + a CNN classifier** — watch [Image Classification with CNNs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGwBXDKFk9I) (**StatQuest**), then skim [d2l Ch. 4 — Softmax Regression](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-classification/index.html). *Softmax + cross-entropy and how a network turns pixels into a class.*
3. **Learn the move that matters** — read [CS231n — Transfer Learning](https://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/) and the [Yosinski et al. paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792). *Freeze vs fine-tune, and why low-level features transfer.*
4. **Do it in code** — follow the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/) (Lesson 1 fine-tunes a pretrained classifier in minutes) and the [PyTorch transfer-learning tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html). *The real freeze-then-fine-tune workflow.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run this chapter's [notebook](code/image-classification.ipynb): a frozen ResNet-18 + linear probe beats a from-scratch CNN by a measured margin, augmentation shrinks the overfitting gap, and every metric is cross-checked against scikit-learn.
