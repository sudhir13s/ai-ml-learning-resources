# Optical Flow & Video Understanding
> **Optical flow** is the per-pixel motion field between two frames — how each pixel moved — estimated
> classically (Lucas–Kanade, Horn–Schunck) under the brightness-constancy assumption, or with deep nets
> (FlowNet, RAFT). **Video understanding** adds the time axis: action recognition with two-stream
> (appearance + flow) or 3D convolutional networks (I3D) that learn spatiotemporal features.

**Why it matters:** the temporal-vision question — state the brightness-constancy + small-motion
assumptions and the aperture problem, contrast sparse (Lucas–Kanade) vs dense flow, explain how flow
feeds video models (two-stream, I3D), and why modeling time is fundamentally harder than single images.
Relevant for video, robotics, AR, and autonomous-driving roles.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **What is optical flow** — watch ⭐ [Overview — Optical Flow (Nayar)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnXFcmLB7sM). *Motion fields and the brightness-constancy idea.*
2. **The classical method** — watch [Lucas–Kanade Method (Nayar)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wMoHgpVUn8). *The sparse-flow workhorse and the aperture problem.*
3. **Go coarse-to-fine** — watch [Hierarchical Lucas–Kanade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i03K_tOwtZ8). *Pyramids handle large motion — the practical trick.*
4. **Read the sources** — [FlowNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852) → ⭐ [RAFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12039) (deep flow), then [Two-Stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2199) → [I3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750) (video action recognition). *Deep flow, then how flow feeds video models.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run the [OpenCV optical-flow tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html) or [torchvision RAFT example](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/auto_examples/others/plot_optical_flow.html). *Compute and visualize flow on real video.*
