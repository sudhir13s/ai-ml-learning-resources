# Detection & Segmentation Metrics — IoU · mAP
> **IoU** (intersection over union) measures how well a predicted box/mask overlaps the ground truth; an
> IoU threshold turns a prediction into a true/false positive. **AP** is the area under that class's
> precision–recall curve, and **mAP** averages AP over all classes (and often over IoU thresholds, e.g.
> COCO's mAP@[.5:.95]). These are *the* numbers every detection/segmentation paper reports.

**Why it matters:** an extremely common, easy-to-probe question — define IoU, explain how an IoU
threshold + confidence ranking builds the PR curve, derive AP and mAP, and explain the difference
between Pascal VOC mAP@0.5 and COCO mAP averaged over thresholds. Interviewers love this because it
tests whether you actually understand how your model is scored, not just how it's trained.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get IoU first** — read ⭐ [Intersection over Union (LearnOpenCV)](https://learnopencv.com/intersection-over-union-iou-in-object-detection-and-segmentation/). *The atomic building block of every detection metric.*
2. **Build intuition for mAP** — watch [What is mAP? (Roboflow)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqXDdxF_Wuw). *From IoU and confidence to a single AP number.*
3. **Work an example** — watch ⭐ [mAP Explained + Implementation (Aladdin Persson)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FppOzcDvaDI). *The full PR-curve → AP → mAP computation, step by step.*
4. **Read the reference** — [COCO detection evaluation](https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval). *The exact mAP@[.5:.95] protocol modern papers report.*
5. **Connect to PR curves** — read [mAP for object detection (LearnOpenCV)](https://learnopencv.com/mean-average-precision-map-object-detection-model-evaluation-metric/). *Ties mAP back to the precision/recall foundation you already know.*
