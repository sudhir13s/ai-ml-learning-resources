# Object Detection — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Object Detection](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/object-detection/object-detection)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free / open (no paywall) and from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on the *detection task and its core machinery* (IoU, NMS, anchors, Average Precision, two-stage vs one-stage), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [How computers learn to recognize objects instantly (TED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgxsv1riJhI) by YOLO's author. *The single-pass detection idea, motivated.*
2. **The full landscape** — watch ⭐ [CS231n Lecture 11 — Detection & Segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDPWywWRIRo) (**Stanford**). *The R-CNN family and one-stage detectors in one authoritative lecture.*
3. **Nail the metric** — watch [mAP (mean Average Precision) explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FppOzcDvaDI) (**Pinecone / James Briggs**), then read the [mAP walkthrough](https://learnopencv.com/mean-average-precision-map-object-detection-model-evaluation-metric/) (**LearnOpenCV**). *IoU → precision/recall → the PR curve → AP → mAP, with worked examples.*
4. **Read the sources** — [R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524) → [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083) → [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) → [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) → [SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) → [RetinaNet (Focal Loss)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) → [DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872). *The two-stage → one-stage → set-prediction arc.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run this chapter's [notebook](code/object-detection.ipynb): a real Faster R-CNN on a real photo, with IoU and NMS cross-checked against `torchvision.ops` and AP pinned to a hand-verified 11/12 worked example.

**In this platform**:
- Concept page (full explanation): [Object Detection](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/object-detection/object-detection)
- Runnable code: [the module `object_detection.py`](code/object_detection.py) · [the step-by-step notebook](code/object-detection.ipynb) — a real Faster R-CNN on a real photo, with IoU and NMS from scratch (cross-checked against `torchvision.ops`) and AP pinned to a hand-verified 11/12 worked example; every metric measured, none mocked.
- The task detection builds on: [04 Image Classification](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/image-classification/image-classification) — a detector is a classifier applied to regions plus a box regressor (we *use* classification here; that page derives it).
- The backbone: [05 Deep Learning › CNNs & Convolution](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/neural-architectures/cnns-and-convolution/cnns-and-convolution) — convolution, receptive fields, and the ResNet backbone every detector runs once over the image.
- The metrics, in depth: [10 Detection & Segmentation Metrics (IoU · mAP)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/detection-and-segmentation-metrics/detection-and-segmentation-metrics) — the dedicated treatment of the evaluation protocol this page derives and measures.
- The sibling dense-prediction tasks: [08 Semantic Segmentation](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/semantic-segmentation/semantic-segmentation) (per-pixel classification) · [09 Instance Segmentation](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/instance-segmentation/instance-segmentation) (detection + a mask head; Mask R-CNN).
- Why generalization is the whole game: [00 Basics › Overfitting & Underfitting](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/ai-ml-orientation/overfitting-and-underfitting/overfitting-and-underfitting) — the gap augmentation and regularization shrink, which matters for training detectors on scarce boxes.
- Where detection goes next: [11 Vision Transformers](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/vision-transformers/vision-transformers) — the ViT backbone and the DETR set-prediction reformulation that removes anchors and NMS.
- Field overview: [Computer Vision](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/computer-vision/readme)
