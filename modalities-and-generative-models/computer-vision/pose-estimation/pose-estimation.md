# Pose Estimation
> Localize a set of **keypoints** (joints: wrists, elbows, knees…) for each person in an image, then
> connect them into a skeleton. The dominant approach predicts per-joint **heatmaps** with a CNN;
> multi-person methods are **top-down** (detect people → estimate each one's pose) or **bottom-up**
> (detect all joints → group them, e.g. OpenPose's Part Affinity Fields). 3D pose lifts this to depth.

**Why it matters:** a focused vision question for AR/robotics/sports/health roles — heatmap regression vs
direct coordinate regression, top-down vs bottom-up trade-offs (accuracy vs speed/scaling with crowd
size), how Part Affinity Fields associate joints to people, and how 2D pose is lifted to 3D. It cleanly
combines detection, dense prediction, and structured output.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch ⭐ [Human Pose Estimation Explained (2D & 3D)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sobpAW16c0). *The task, keypoints, and the 2D→3D distinction.*
2. **See it run** — watch [OpenPose Body Keypoint Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZbptWIXCos). *A real multi-person bottom-up system in action.*
3. **Hands-on** — watch [Human Pose Estimation with Deep Learning (LearnOpenCV)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCoR-mF3KI8). *Run a heatmap-based estimator end to end.*
4. **Read the sources** — [DeepPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4659) → [OpenPose (Part Affinity Fields)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08050) → ⭐ [Simple Baselines for Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06208). *Regression → bottom-up association → the strong heatmap baseline.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work through [MediaPipe Pose Landmarker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/pose_landmarker). *Production-grade real-time pose with code.*
