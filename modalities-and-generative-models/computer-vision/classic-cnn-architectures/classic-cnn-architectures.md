# Classic CNN Architectures — LeNet · AlexNet · VGG · ResNet · Inception · EfficientNet
> The lineage of image-classification backbones: **LeNet** (1998) proved convnets work, **AlexNet**
> (2012) sparked the deep-learning era on ImageNet, **VGG** went deep with stacked 3×3 convs,
> **Inception** added multi-scale parallel paths, **ResNet** made 100+ layers trainable via skip
> connections, and **EfficientNet** balanced depth/width/resolution with compound scaling.

**Why it matters:** the single most-asked vision question — "walk me through the ImageNet architectures
and what each one fixed." You should be able to explain why AlexNet's ReLU+dropout mattered, why VGG
stacks 3×3s, what Inception modules do, why residual connections solve degradation, and what compound
scaling buys EfficientNet. These backbones are also the default feature extractors for transfer learning.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Why CNNs for vision** — watch [Computer Vision (Andrew Ng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArPaAX_PhIs). *Sets up why we need specialized architectures for images.*
2. **The full lineage** — watch ⭐ [CS231n Lec 9: CNN Architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAOcjicFr1Y). *AlexNet → VGG → GoogLeNet → ResNet in one authoritative lecture.*
3. **Master the key idea** — watch [ResNet explained in 10 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_3mboe1jYI), then read the ⭐ [ResNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). *Residual learning is the most important architectural idea — and a guaranteed interview topic.*
4. **Read the sources** — [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) → [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) → [GoogLeNet/Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) → [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946). *The progression of ideas that each won/advanced ImageNet.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work through [d2l: Modern CNNs](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/index.html). *Implement AlexNet/VGG/ResNet blocks to internalize the design.*
