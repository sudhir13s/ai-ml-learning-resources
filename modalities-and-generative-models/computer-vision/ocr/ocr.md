# Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
> Turn text *in images* into machine-readable strings. Modern OCR is two stages: **text detection**
> (locate text regions/boxes, e.g. EAST/CRAFT) and **text recognition** (read each crop into characters).
> The classic recognition model is **CRNN** — CNN features → BiLSTM → **CTC** loss — which reads
> variable-length text without character-level alignment. Newer systems use transformer decoders (TrOCR).

**Why it matters:** a focused applied question for document-AI, fintech, and search roles — the
detection+recognition pipeline, why CTC solves the alignment problem (no per-character labels needed),
how CRNN combines convolution and recurrence, and the trade-offs between classic engines (Tesseract),
deep pipelines (EasyOCR), and end-to-end transformers (TrOCR).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Understand the alignment problem** — watch ⭐ [Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDPl1QJGLpE). *Why CTC is the key idea that makes sequence reading work without alignment.*
2. **See the tools** — watch [OCR with Python — Tesseract vs EasyOCR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7TTbDZ-KHQ). *The two main practical engines, compared.*
3. **Compare approaches** — watch [Tesseract vs EasyOCR vs Textract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcC3h0waQ6I). *Where classic vs deep vs cloud OCR each win.*
4. **Read the sources** — ⭐ [CRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717) → [STN-OCR / attention OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03985). *The CNN+RNN+CTC architecture and attention-based reading.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) or [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR). *Extract text from a real document end to end.*
