# Self-Supervised Vision — SimCLR · MAE · DINO
> Learn strong visual representations from **unlabeled** images by inventing a pretext task. Three
> families dominate: **contrastive** (SimCLR pulls two augmented views of the same image together,
> pushes others apart via InfoNCE), **masked image modeling** (MAE masks ~75% of patches and
> reconstructs them with a ViT), and **self-distillation** (DINO matches student/teacher outputs,
> yielding emergent segmentation). The pretrained features then transfer with few or no labels.

**Why it matters:** the modern representation-learning question — why self-supervision matters when
labels are expensive, how contrastive learning's positive/negative pairs and InfoNCE work, the role of
augmentation in defining "views," why MAE's high masking ratio works, and how DINO produces
object-segmentation attention for free. Central to foundation-model and multimodal interviews.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition (contrastive)** — watch ⭐ [Contrastive Learning — SimCLR illustrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgeWsuyRH8) (AI Bites). *Positive/negative pairs, augmentation views, and the contrastive loss.*
2. **Go a bit deeper** — watch [Can Contrastive Learning Work? — SimCLR Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Id8SPH31UE). *Why big batches, projection heads, and strong augmentation matter.*
3. **Masked image modeling** — watch [Masked Autoencoders (MAE) Paper Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EBqzYIJRaQ), then read the ⭐ [MAE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377). *Mask 75% of patches, reconstruct with an asymmetric ViT encoder/decoder.*
4. **Read the sources** — [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) → [BYOL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733) (no negatives) → [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294) (self-distillation). *The three paradigms and their key tricks.*
5. **See it work** — read [Meta AI: DINO](https://ai.meta.com/blog/dino-paws-computer-vision-with-self-supervised-transformers-and-10x-more-efficient-training/). *Emergent segmentation maps from purely self-supervised ViTs.*
