# Audio & Speech
> Models that *listen and talk* — audio representations and neural codecs, speech recognition
> (ASR), speech synthesis (TTS), and the realtime voice stack. Audio *diffusion/music
> generation* details live with [Diffusion](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/diffusion-models/readme); this topic owns the
> speech pipeline end to end.

**⭐ Start here:** [Hugging Face Audio Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course) — **Hugging Face** — free, code-first path through representations → ASR → TTS.

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) with its page.
> **✅ ready · ⬜ coming soon.** Representations first — everything downstream stands on them.

### Representations & codecs
1. ⬜ Audio Representations (waveform · spectrogram · mel · MFCC)
2. ⬜ Audio Tokenization & Neural Codecs (SoundStream · EnCodec · discrete audio tokens)

### Speech recognition
3. ⬜ ASR Fundamentals (CTC · seq2seq · WER and its traps)
4. ⬜ Self-Supervised Speech (wav2vec 2.0 · HuBERT)
5. ⬜ Whisper & Large-Scale Weakly-Supervised ASR

### Speech synthesis
6. ⬜ TTS Fundamentals (Tacotron lineage · VITS · vocoders)
7. ⬜ Modern TTS & Voice Cloning (codec LMs · zero-shot voices · safety)

### Systems & applications
8. ⬜ Speaker Identification & Diarization
9. ⬜ Realtime & Streaming Voice (latency budgets · VAD · barge-in · voice agents)
10. ⬜ Music & Audio Generation overview (codec LMs · pointers to diffusion)
