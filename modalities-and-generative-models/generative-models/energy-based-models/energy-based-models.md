# Energy-Based Models (EBM)
> Model an unnormalized density `p(x) ∝ exp(−E_θ(x))` with a neural **energy function** `E_θ` — low
> energy for real data, high for everything else. No restrictions on the network (no invertibility, no
> tractable latents), but the **partition function** `Z` is intractable, so training uses
> **contrastive divergence**: lower the energy of real samples, raise the energy of model samples
> drawn by **MCMC / Langevin dynamics**. EBMs unify GANs, score models, and classifiers under one lens.

**Why it matters:** the conceptual glue of generative modeling — score-based diffusion, the
GAN discriminator, and even a softmax classifier are all EBMs in disguise. Interviews probe: why `Z`
makes exact maximum likelihood intractable; the **contrastive-divergence** gradient (a difference of
expectations over data and model samples); how **Langevin dynamics** sample from `E_θ` using only
`∇_x E_θ` (the **score**), linking EBMs directly to score-based diffusion; and the practical
difficulty — MCMC mixing is slow and training is unstable, which is why EBMs are elegant but less used
in production than diffusion.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [NYU DL — Energy-Based Models (Week 7 notes)](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP20/en/week07/07-1/) — **LeCun / Canziani (NYU)**. *Low-energy-for-real, high-for-fake — the EBM picture and why it generalizes feed-forward nets.*
2. **See why it works** — watch [NYU Deep Learning Week 7 — Energy-based models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHxKk5Y5ayc) — **LeCun / Canziani (NYU)**. *EBMs as the general framework; contrastive vs architectural methods.*
3. **Get the math** — work through [UvA DL — Deep Energy-Based Generative Models](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial8/Deep_Energy_Models.html) — **University of Amsterdam**. *Contrastive divergence + Langevin sampling, derived and coded.*
4. **Read the source** — [Implicit Generation and Modeling with Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08689) — **Du & Mordatch (2019)**. *Modern EBM training with Langevin-dynamics sampling on images.*
5. **Make it concrete** — connect it to diffusion via [Yang Song's score blog](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/). *Seeing `∇_x log p(x) = −∇_x E_θ(x)` is the unifying "aha."*
