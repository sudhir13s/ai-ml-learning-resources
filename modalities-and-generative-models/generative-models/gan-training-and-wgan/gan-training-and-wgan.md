# GAN Training Pathologies & WGAN
> GANs are notoriously hard to train: **mode collapse** (the generator emits a few samples that fool
> `D`), **vanishing gradients** when `D` gets too good, and oscillation/non-convergence. The
> **Wasserstein GAN** replaces the JS-divergence objective with the **Earth-Mover (Wasserstein-1)
> distance**, which gives smooth, non-vanishing gradients — enforced by a **Lipschitz** constraint
> (weight clipping in WGAN, a **gradient penalty** in WGAN-GP).

**Why it matters:** the "why won't my GAN train?" interview, and a clean test of whether you
understand *divergences*. Be ready to explain why JS divergence saturates when supports don't overlap
(zero gradient), what the Wasserstein distance measures and why it stays informative, the
Kantorovich–Rubinstein duality that turns it into a maximization over **1-Lipschitz critics**, why
weight clipping is a crude Lipschitz hack, and how **WGAN-GP** fixes it with a gradient-norm penalty.
Also: practical stabilizers (spectral normalization, TTUR, label smoothing) and how to *diagnose*
mode collapse.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [Common Problems with GANs](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/problems) — **Google**. *Names and shows mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and non-convergence first.*
2. **See why it works** — read [Read-through: Wasserstein GAN](https://www.alexirpan.com/2017/02/22/wasserstein-gan.html) — **Alex Irpan**. *The clearest "why JS fails and EM distance saves it" explanation.*
3. **Get the math** — read [From GAN to WGAN](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2017-08-20-gan/) (WGAN section) — **Lilian Weng** + watch [Nuts and Bolts of WGANs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31mqB4yGgQY) — **Crazymuse**. *Earth-Mover distance, Kantorovich–Rubinstein duality, the Lipschitz constraint.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) — **Arjovsky et al. (2017)** → [Improved Training of WGANs (WGAN-GP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028) — **Gulrajani et al. (2017)**. *The distance, then the gradient-penalty fix for clipping.*
5. **Make it concrete** — implement it with [WGAN-GP from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG0QZ7OddX4) — **Aladdin Persson**. *Coding the critic + gradient penalty makes the Lipschitz constraint tangible.*
