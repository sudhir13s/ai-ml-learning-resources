# Evaluation of Generative Models — FID · Inception Score
> Likelihood doesn't exist (GANs) or doesn't correlate with sample quality, so we evaluate generative
> models with **feature-space statistics**. **Inception Score (IS)** rewards confident, diverse
> ImageNet classifications. **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)** fits Gaussians to Inception features
> of real vs. generated images and measures the Fréchet distance between them — lower is better, and
> it captures *both* fidelity and diversity. **Precision/Recall** disentangles the two.

**Why it matters:** "how do you know your generator is good?" is asked of every GAN/diffusion
candidate. Interviews probe: why we can't just use log-likelihood; how IS works and its flaws (no
comparison to real data, blind to mode collapse within a class, ImageNet-biased); the **FID** formula
`‖μ_r − μ_g‖² + Tr(Σ_r + Σ_g − 2(Σ_r Σ_g)^½)` and why it's the field standard (sensitive to mode
collapse and blur, but biased by sample size); the **precision (fidelity) vs. recall (coverage)** split
that a single number hides; and **CLIP-score** for text-to-image prompt alignment.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Fréchet Inception Distance and Inception Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlk3JA2aJ-g) — **AI Bits and Pieces**. *What the two metrics measure, in a few minutes.*
2. **See why it works** — read [How to Implement the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-implement-the-frechet-inception-distance-fid-from-scratch/) — **Jason Brownlee**. *The Inception-feature Gaussians and the Fréchet distance, with code.*
3. **Get the math** — watch [Evaluating GANs with Inception Score and FID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGbhEDDb8NA) — **Giuseppe Canale** + read [How to Evaluate GANs using FID](https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/gan-evaluation/reports/How-to-Evaluate-GANs-using-Frechet-Inception-Distance-FID---Vmlldzo0MTAxOTc) — **Weights & Biases**. *The IS KL-divergence and the FID formula derived.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Improved Techniques for Training GANs (IS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498) → [GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule (FID)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500) → [Improved Precision and Recall Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06991). *IS, then FID, then the precision/recall refinement.*
5. **Make it concrete** — compute FID with [`pytorch-fid`](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) on your own samples. *Watching FID drop as samples improve makes it tangible.*
