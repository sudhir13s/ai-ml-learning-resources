# GANs & DCGAN — the Adversarial Game
> Train two networks against each other: a **generator** `G` maps noise `z` to fake samples, and a
> **discriminator** `D` tries to tell real from fake. They play a minimax game; at the optimum `G`'s
> distribution matches the data and `D` is stuck at 50/50. **DCGAN** is the convolutional recipe that
> first made GAN training stable enough for real images (strided convs, batchnorm, no pooling).

**Why it matters:** the foundational adversarial idea and a perennial interview topic. You'll be asked
to write the **minimax value function**, explain what `D` and `G` each optimize, derive that the
optimal discriminator is `D*(x)=p_data/(p_data+p_g)` and that the global optimum minimizes the
**Jensen–Shannon divergence**, and explain the **non-saturating** generator loss (why `−log D(G(z))`
is used in practice instead of `log(1−D(G(z)))`). DCGAN gives the concrete architectural choices that
"just work." (Training pathologies and the Wasserstein fix live in the [next card](../gan-training-and-wgan/gan-training-and-wgan.md).)

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw9r8CL98N0) — **Computerphile**. *The counterfeiter-vs-detective story that makes the adversarial loop click.*
2. **See why it works** — play with [GAN Lab](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/) — **Polo Club (Georgia Tech)**. *Watch the two distributions chase each other in your browser, no install.*
3. **Get the math** — watch [The Math Behind GANs, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gib_kiXgnvA) — **Normalized Nerd** + read [From GAN to WGAN](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2017-08-20-gan/) (first half) — **Lilian Weng**. *The value function, optimal `D`, and the JS-divergence result.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) — **Goodfellow et al. (2014)** → [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) — **Radford et al. (2015)**. *The original game, then the conv recipe that stabilized it.*
5. **Make it concrete** — code one with the [TensorFlow DCGAN tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan). *Implementing `G`/`D` and the alternating updates cements the loop.*
