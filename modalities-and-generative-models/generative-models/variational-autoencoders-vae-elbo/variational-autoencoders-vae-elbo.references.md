# Variational Autoencoders (VAE · ELBO) — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Variational Autoencoders (VAE · ELBO)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/generative-models/variational-autoencoders-vae-elbo/variational-autoencoders-vae-elbo)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free / open (no paywall) and from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *VAEs specifically* (the ELBO, the reparameterization trick, the closed-form Gaussian KL, and the β-VAE / posterior-collapse story), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch ⭐ [Variational Autoencoders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zKuYvjFFS8) by **Arxiv Insights (Xander Steenbrugge)**. *The clearest first picture: a continuous, sampleable latent space instead of a fixed code, and why that lets you generate.*
2. **See why it works** — read [From Autoencoder to Beta-VAE](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/) by **Lilian Weng (OpenAI)**. *Walks the ELBO, the reparameterization trick, the closed-form KL, and β-VAE carefully — the canonical open write-up.*
3. **Get the math** — read [Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908) by **Doersch (2016)**. *The most readable end-to-end ELBO derivation and the variational-inference framing you may be asked to reproduce.*
4. **Read the source** — [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) by **Kingma & Welling (2013)**. *The paper that introduced the VAE and the reparameterized ELBO estimator.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run this chapter's [notebook](code/variational-autoencoders-vae-elbo.ipynb): a from-scratch VAE trained on real MNIST, with the closed-form Gaussian KL asserted equal to a Monte-Carlo estimate of KL(q‖p), the reparameterization trick's gradient flow proven, and real reconstructions, prior samples, and a 2-D latent manifold.

**Videos**:
- [Variational Autoencoders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zKuYvjFFS8) — **Arxiv Insights (Xander Steenbrugge)** — the best gentle first watch: latent space, sampling, and why a VAE is generative where an autoencoder is not.
- [MIT 6.S191: Deep Generative Modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G5hWM6jqPk) — **Alexander Amini (MIT)** — the lecture treatment: ELBO, the KL term, the reparameterization trick, then GANs, from the free MIT intro-to-deep-learning course.
- [Variational Autoencoders | Generative AI Animated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJeaCHQ1k2w) — **Deepia** — a clean animated derivation of the ELBO and the reparameterization trick, 3Blue1Brown-style.
- [Variational Autoencoder Paper Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bA6gwo36Cw) — **Aladdin Persson** — reads the Kingma & Welling paper line by line, then codes a VAE in PyTorch — the implementer's view of everything on this page.

- [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) — **Kingma & Welling (2013/2014), ICLR** — the original VAE: amortized variational inference + the reparameterized ELBO estimator. The source for everything on this page.
- [Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082) — **Rezende, Mohamed & Wierstra (2014), ICML** — the equivalent stochastic-backpropagation formulation of the reparameterized gradient, developed independently and concurrently.
- [Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908) — **Doersch (2016)** — the most readable long-form VAE derivation; treat it as the extended explanation of the math here.
- [β-VAE: Learning Basic Visual Concepts with a Constrained Variational Framework](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl) — **Higgins et al. (2017), ICLR** — the KL-weighting knob (β) and the disentanglement it buys, the trade-off measured in this chapter.
- [An Introduction to Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02691) — **Kingma & Welling (2019)** — the authors' own book-length modern treatment (free on arXiv), covering the ELBO, reparameterization, and extensions.

**In this platform**:
- Concept page (full explanation): [Variational Autoencoders (VAE · ELBO)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/generative-models/variational-autoencoders-vae-elbo/variational-autoencoders-vae-elbo)
- Runnable code: [the module `vae.py`](code/vae.py) · [the step-by-step notebook](code/variational-autoencoders-vae-elbo.ipynb) — a from-scratch VAE trained on real MNIST, with the closed-form Gaussian KL asserted equal to a Monte-Carlo estimate of KL(q‖p), the reparameterization trick's gradient flow proven (a raw `.sample()` carries no gradient), and real reconstructions, prior samples, a 2-D latent manifold, an interpolation, and the β trade-off; every number computed, none fabricated.
- The deterministic precursor: [05 Deep Learning · 19 Autoencoders](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/neural-architectures/autoencoders/autoencoders) — compresses and reconstructs, but its latent space is a bag of holes; the VAE adds the probabilistic, sampleable latent.
- The same ELBO, fit by EM: [04 Unsupervised Learning · 04 Gaussian Mixture Models & EM](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/unsupervised-learning/clustering/gaussian-mixture-models-and-em/gaussian-mixture-models-and-em) — the ELBO / KL-gap identity this page reuses; EM climbs it by a per-datapoint E-step, a VAE by an *amortized* encoder network.
- The closed-form KL: [01 Foundations · 23 Cross-Entropy and KL Divergence](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/mathematical-foundations/cross-entropy-and-kl-divergence/cross-entropy-and-kl-divergence) — where the two-Gaussian KL (the VAE regulariser) is derived; the VAE specializes it to a unit-Gaussian prior.
- The gradient engine: [05 Deep Learning · 02 Backpropagation and Computational Graphs](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/neural-network-foundations/backpropagation-and-computational-graphs/backpropagation-and-computational-graphs) — the reparameterization trick exists so that ordinary backprop can reach the encoder's μ and log σ².
- The variance contrast: [08 Reinforcement Learning · 09 Policy Gradients (REINFORCE)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/policy-learning/policy-gradients-reinforce/policy-gradients-reinforce) — the *score-function* estimator, the high-variance alternative you must use when you *cannot* reparameterize; the VAE's pathwise estimator is the low-variance counterpart.
- The family contrast: [02 GANs and DCGAN](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/generative-models/gans-and-dcgan/gans-and-dcgan) — adversarial, sharp, unstable, no likelihood; the VAE is likelihood-based, stable, and blurry.
- Where it goes next: [05 Diffusion Models (DDPM)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/diffusion-models/diffusion-models-ddpm/diffusion-models-ddpm) — a many-step hierarchical VAE trained by a per-step ELBO; the VAE is its one-step conceptual seed.
- Where the VAE lives in the real world: [07 Latent Diffusion / Stable Diffusion](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/diffusion-models/latent-diffusion-stable-diffusion/latent-diffusion-stable-diffusion) — diffusion runs in the compact latent space of a pretrained VAE; encode → diffuse → decode.
