# Score-Based & SDE Diffusion
> A second, equivalent view of diffusion: instead of predicting noise, learn the **score** — the
> gradient of the log-density `∇_x log p(x)` — at every noise level, then sample by following it with
> **Langevin dynamics**. Yang Song's **SDE framework** unifies score-matching and DDPM: a continuous
> **forward SDE** noises the data and a **reverse-time SDE** generates it, with a deterministic
> **probability-flow ODE** giving fast, exact-likelihood sampling.

**Why it matters:** the theory that explains *why* diffusion works and connects all the variants. It's
the basis for fast samplers (DDIM, DPM-Solver) and exact likelihoods. Interviews probe: what the score
function is and why estimating it avoids the intractable normalizing constant; **denoising score
matching** and its equivalence to DDPM's noise-prediction loss; how **annealed Langevin dynamics**
sample across noise scales; the forward/reverse **SDE** pair (Anderson's theorem) and the **VE vs VP**
SDEs (NCSN vs DDPM as special cases); and the **probability-flow ODE** that turns the SDE into a
deterministic, invertible map.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/) — **Yang Song**. *The author's own blog: scores, Langevin sampling, and the SDE unification, with animations.*
2. **See why it works** — watch [Diffusion Models From Scratch | Score-Based Generative Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4oHJpEJBAA) — **Outlier**. *Connects the score view to the DDPM noise-prediction view you already know.*
3. **Get the math** — watch [Diffusion and Score-Based Generative Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMmqCMwuM2Q) — **Yang Song (MIT CBMM lecture)**. *The definitive talk: score matching, the SDE, and the probability-flow ODE.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients (NCSN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600) — **Song & Ermon (2019)** → [Score-Based Generative Modeling through SDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456) — **Song et al. (2021)**. *Annealed Langevin first, then the SDE framework that subsumes DDPM.*
5. **Make it concrete** — read [The Annotated Diffusion Model](https://huggingface.co/blog/annotated-diffusion) — **Hugging Face**, then map `ε`-prediction to score `s_θ ≈ −ε/σ`. *Seeing the two parameterizations coincide is the "aha."*
