# Sampling & Guidance Techniques — DDIM · Solvers · Guidance Scale
> A trained diffusion model is only half the story — *how you sample* decides speed and quality.
> **DDIM** makes the reverse process non-Markovian and deterministic, cutting 1000 steps to ~20–50.
> **ODE solvers** (DPM-Solver, EDM/Heun) push that to ~10 steps via the probability-flow ODE. And
> **guidance** — classifier and classifier-free — is the knob that trades diversity for fidelity, with
> the **guidance scale** as its single most important sampling-time hyperparameter.

**Why it matters:** the practical layer between "I have a model" and "I get good images fast," and a
common follow-up to the diffusion question. Interviews probe: why vanilla **DDPM ancestral sampling**
needs hundreds of steps; how **DDIM** reuses the same network with a deterministic, non-Markovian
update (enabling fewer steps, interpolation, and inversion); the **probability-flow ODE** view that
turns sampling into ODE integration solvable by higher-order solvers in ~10 steps; and the
**guidance-scale trade-off** — higher `s` improves prompt adherence and fidelity but reduces diversity
and can over-saturate.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [Guidance: a cheat code for diffusion models](https://sander.ai/2022/05/26/guidance.html) — **Sander Dieleman**. *What the guidance scale does and the fidelity/diversity trade-off, intuitively.*
2. **See why it works** — watch [Diffusion models explained: how does OpenAI's GLIDE work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=344w5h24-h8) — **AI Coffee Break (Letitia)**. *Guidance in action and how it sharpens conditional samples.*
3. **Get the math** — read [What are Diffusion Models? (sampling & DDIM)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/) — **Lilian Weng** + [Yang Song's score blog (probability-flow ODE)](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/). *DDIM's non-Markovian update and the ODE view behind fast solvers.*
4. **Read the sources** — [DDIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502) — **Song et al. (2021)** · [DPM-Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927) — **Lu et al. (2022)** · [Classifier-Free Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598) — **Ho & Salimans (2022)** · [EDM design space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) — **Karras et al. (2022)**. *Faster samplers, then the unifying design space.*
5. **Make it concrete** — swap schedulers in the [Diffusers schedulers guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/schedulers) and sweep the guidance scale. *Feeling steps↔quality and scale↔diversity cements it.*
