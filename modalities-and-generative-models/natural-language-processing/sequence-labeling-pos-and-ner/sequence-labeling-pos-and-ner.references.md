# Sequence Labeling — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Sequence Labeling — POS & NER](sequence-labeling-pos-and-ner.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame the task** — read [SLP3 Ch. 17](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/17.pdf) intro on POS/NER and BIO tagging (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *Get the task and tagging schemes before any model.*
2. **See HMM + Viterbi** — watch [POS Tagging using the Viterbi algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYzTTFxcc9I) (**Data Science in your pocket**), then the [fully worked numeric example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBemI2BapE0). *The classic generative tagger, decoded by hand.*
3. **Get the CRF** — read [SLP3 Ch. 17 §17.4](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/17.pdf) and Sutton & McCallum's [CRF tutorial](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/publications/crftutv2.pdf). *Why a globally-normalized CRF beats the MEMM — the part interviews probe.*
4. **Read the neural sources** — [biLSTM-CRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01991) → [Neural NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360) → [end-to-end char-CNN-biLSTM-CRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01354). *How LSTMs + a CRF layer became the standard.*
5. **Make it concrete** — try [spaCy NER](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities) or the [HF token-classification tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tasks/token_classification), and score with [seqeval](https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval). *Tag real text, inspect spans, compute entity F1.*
