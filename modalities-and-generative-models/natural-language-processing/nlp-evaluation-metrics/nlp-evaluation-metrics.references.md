# NLP Evaluation Metrics — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[NLP Evaluation Metrics](nlp-evaluation-metrics.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author (the paper's authors) or a recognized deep explainer, chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. Every link verified.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — read [SLP3 Ch. 3 §"Perplexity"](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf) and [SLP3 Ch. 13 §"MT Evaluation / BLEU"](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/13.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *The two anchor metrics, defined precisely.*
2. **See BLEU explained** — watch [BLEU Score (C5W3L06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DejHQYAGb7Q) (**Andrew Ng**), then [What is the BLEU metric?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M05L1DhFqcw) (**Hugging Face**). *Clipped n-gram precision + brevity penalty, two ways.*
3. **Read the sources** — [BLEU](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040/) → [ROUGE](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/) → [BERTScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675). *Surface overlap, then embedding-based scoring.*
4. **See where surface metrics break** — read [How NOT To Evaluate Your Dialogue System](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1230/) (**Liu et al. 2016**). *Why BLEU/ROUGE correlate near-zero on open-ended text.*
5. **Reach the modern paradigm** — read [Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) (**Zheng et al. 2023**). *LLM-as-judge, its agreement with humans, and its biases.*
6. **Make it concrete** — compute everything with the [Hugging Face `evaluate` library](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/index). *Score real model outputs.*
