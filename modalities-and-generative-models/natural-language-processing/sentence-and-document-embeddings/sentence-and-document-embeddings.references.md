# Sentence & Document Embeddings — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Sentence & Document Embeddings](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/sentence-and-document-embeddings/sentence-and-document-embeddings)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Intro to Sentence Embeddings with Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVPd7lEvjtg) (**James Briggs**). *Why a sentence needs its own vector, not a bag of token vectors, and the cosine-similarity intuition.*
2. **See why SBERT works** — watch [SBERT (Sentence Transformers) is not BERT Sentence Embedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVqwznaVi78) (**Discover AI**). *The siamese trick that makes pooled vectors comparable.*
3. **Read the source** — [Sentence-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) (**Reimers & Gurevych, 2019**). *Architecture, pooling, the three objectives, and the 65-hours → 5-seconds result.*
4. **Get hands-on** — read the [SentenceTransformers docs](https://www.sbert.net/) + [semantic-search guide](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html). *Embed, index, query, and rerank in a few lines.*
5. **Go contrastive** — read [SimCSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08821) (**Gao et al., 2021**). *Dropout as a free positive pair; the modern training recipe.*
