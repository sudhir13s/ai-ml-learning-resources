# Sequence-to-Sequence & Encoder–Decoder — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Sequence-to-Sequence & Encoder–Decoder](sequence-to-sequence-and-encoder-decoder.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the intuition** — watch [Seq2Seq Encoder–Decoder Neural Networks, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8HKweZIOmg) (**StatQuest**). *The encoder → context → decoder picture, gently, before any attention.*
2. **See why attention is needed** — read [Visualizing A Neural Machine Translation Model (seq2seq with attention)](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) (**Jay Alammar**). *Watch the single-vector bottleneck appear and attention dissolve it.*
3. **Get the math** — read [Seq2seq and Attention](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course/seq2seq_and_attention.html) (**Lena Voita, NLP Course for You**). *Encoder, decoder, attention scores, alignment, and training — rigorous and free.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Seq2Seq (Sutskever et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) + [Cho et al. GRU encoder–decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078) → [Bahdanau et al. attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473). *The bottleneck, then its fix, in the original words.*
5. **Build it** — code the [PyTorch seq2seq-with-attention translation tutorial](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html). *A translating encoder–decoder with attention, end to end, and the alignment plots.*

**Runnable code (this chapter)**:

- [`seq2seq.py` — the seeded source of truth](code/seq2seq.py) — encoder, both decoders, training, free-running accuracy, alignment-matrix extractor, greedy/beam demo (device-agnostic).
- [`make_figures_08.py` — figure generator](code/make_figures_08.py) — regenerates every figure on the page from the *same* functions, so the prose and figures cannot drift.
