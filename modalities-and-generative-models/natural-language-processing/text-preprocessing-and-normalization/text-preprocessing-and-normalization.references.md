# Text Preprocessing & Normalization — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Text Preprocessing & Normalization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/text-preprocessing-and-normalization/text-preprocessing-and-normalization)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See the pipeline whole** — read [An Introduction to NLP](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-nlp/) (**Victor Zhou**). *The end-to-end picture of what each preprocessing step does, before the tools.*
2. **Get the canonical definitions** — read [Speech and Language Processing, Ch. 2](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/2.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *Normalization, tokenization, and edit distance in the standard textbook.*
3. **Nail stemming vs lemmatization** — read [Stemming and lemmatization](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html) (**Manning, IR Book Ch. 2**), then watch [Stemming and Lemmatization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHAilAC3cXw) (**codebasics**). *The precise distinction interviewers probe, then seen in code.*
4. **Understand Unicode normalization** — skim [UAX #15: Unicode Normalization Forms](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/) (**Unicode Consortium**). *Why NFC vs NFKC matters and what each form does.*
5. **Run a real pipeline** — work through [NLTK Book Ch. 3](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch03.html) and [spaCy linguistic features](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features). *Tokenize, stem, lemmatize on raw text with two production libraries.*
