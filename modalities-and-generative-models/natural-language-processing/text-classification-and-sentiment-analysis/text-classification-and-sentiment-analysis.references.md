# Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/text-classification-and-sentiment-analysis/text-classification-and-sentiment-analysis)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal cross-links, kept separate so this can be reused as a standalone reading list. Grouped by type, best-first; every entry is a primary author or a recognized deep explainer, chosen for depth on *this* topic and verified to load.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the intuition** — read [SLP3 Ch. 4 "Naive Bayes, Text Classification, and Sentiment"](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *The bag-of-words view of classification, Naive Bayes derived, sentiment.*
2. **See the strong baseline** — read [Text classification](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course/text_classification.html) (**Lena Voita**). *From BoW + logistic regression up to neural classifiers — the clearest free survey.*
3. **Build a classic pipeline** — watch [Real-World ML with Scikit-Learn (NLP, classifiers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Itm95JzL0) (**Keith Galli**). *TF-IDF → classifier on real text, end to end.*
4. **Go neural** — read the [CNN-for-text paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) (**Kim 2014**) and watch [Text Classification Using BERT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9yyt6BfgAM) (**codebasics**). *When and why deep models help.*
5. **Make it concrete** — follow the [HF text-classification guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sequence_classification) and try the [zero-shot pipeline](https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-classification). *Fine-tune a transformer, and classify with no labels at all.*
