# N-gram Language Models and Smoothing: counting your way to probability

Suppose I hand you the fragment *"I'd like to make a collect …"* and ask you to bet on the next word. You'll say **call** without hesitating — not because you parsed the grammar, but because in all the English you've ever heard, *collect* is followed by *call* far more often than by *banana*. A **language model** is just that instinct made into arithmetic: a function that assigns a **probability to a sequence of words**, and equivalently predicts **how likely each next word is given the words so far**. The **N-gram** model is the oldest, simplest, and most instructive way to build one — you literally **count** which words follow which, and turn those counts into probabilities.

This page is the *complete* tour I'd give a teammate before an interview or before they touch a modern LLM, because every idea here — the **chain rule**, the **Markov assumption**, **maximum-likelihood counts**, the **sparsity catastrophe**, the whole **smoothing** family, and **perplexity** — survives, unchanged in spirit, into the neural and transformer models that replaced n-grams. We'll *derive* each result rather than state it, work **six numeric examples by hand** (all reproduced by the runnable code), and finish with a from-scratch model you can run. By the end you'll be able to:

- write the **chain-rule** factorization of a sentence's probability and explain the **Markov assumption** that turns it into an n-gram;
- **derive** the maximum-likelihood estimate $p(w_i \mid w_{i-1}) = c(w_{i-1}, w_i)/c(w_{i-1})$ and compute it by hand;
- explain and *demonstrate numerically* the **zero-probability catastrophe** that makes raw counts unusable;
- climb the **smoothing ladder** — Laplace, add-k, Good-Turing, Katz backoff, interpolation, and **Kneser-Ney** — deriving what each one does to the probability mass and *why*;
- **derive perplexity** $\mathrm{PP}(W) = 2^{-\frac1N \sum \log_2 p}$, read it as a branching factor, and connect it to cross-entropy (the *same* metric neural LMs report);
- state precisely **why** n-grams hit a wall, and how that wall motivated word embeddings and neural language models.

> **Note:** "n-gram" means a contiguous run of $n$ tokens. A **unigram** is one word ($n{=}1$), a **bigram** two ($n{=}2$, "machine learning"), a **trigram** three ($n{=}3$, "the cat sat"). An **n-gram language model** uses (n−1)-word context to predict the next word. The whole field is built on choosing $n$ and dealing with the consequences.

> **Runnable project and a step-by-step notebook:** every number, table, and figure on this page is produced by the verified code next to it — see the [step-by-step teaching notebook](code/n-gram-language-models-and-smoothing.ipynb), the [single source-of-truth module](code/ngram_lm.py) (`python ngram_lm.py`), and the [figure generator](code/make_figures_04.py) (`python make_figures_04.py`). The page, the notebook, and the figures all import the *same* functions from `ngram_lm.py`, so they cannot drift apart.

## The problem: assign a probability to a sentence

A language model answers one deceptively simple question: **given a string of words, how probable is it?** Formally, for a sequence $W = w_1 w_2 \dots w_n$ we want

$$P(W) = P(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n).$$

Why would you ever want this? Because *every* generative language task is secretly a ranking over sequences:

- **Speech recognition** — "recognize speech" vs. "wreck a nice beach" sound nearly identical; the LM picks the more probable word sequence.
- **Machine translation** — among many fluent renderings of a foreign sentence, prefer the one with higher $P(W)$ in the target language.
- **Spelling/grammar correction** — "their going to school" scores lower than "they're going to school".
- **Autocomplete / generation** — emit the next word that maximizes (or samples from) $P(w_i \mid \text{context})$.

So the modeling target is a probability distribution over the (infinite) set of all word sequences. The trouble is obvious: there are far too many possible sentences to ever estimate $P(W)$ directly by counting whole sentences — you'd need to have *seen the exact sentence before*, and almost every sentence anyone utters is brand new. We need to **break the joint probability into pieces we *can* estimate.** That decomposition is the chain rule.

> **Note:** a language model is not a classifier over a fixed label set; its "label space" is the entire vocabulary at *every* position, conditioned on everything before. That is exactly why decomposition is mandatory — and exactly why the same machinery scales from n-grams to GPT.

---

## Deriving the chain rule

The chain rule of probability is just the repeated application of the definition of conditional probability, $P(A, B) = P(A)\,P(B \mid A)$. Apply it left to right across the whole sentence:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n)
&= P(w_1)\, P(w_2 \mid w_1)\, P(w_3 \mid w_1, w_2) \cdots P(w_n \mid w_1, \dots, w_{n-1}) \\[4pt]
&= \prod_{i=1}^{n} P\!\left(w_i \mid w_1, \dots, w_{i-1}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

Read it aloud: **the probability of a sentence is the product, over each position, of the probability of that word given every word before it.** No approximation yet — this is *exact*. The chain rule converts one impossible estimation (the whole joint) into a sequence of next-word predictions.

> **Source / derivation:** the chain-rule factorization of $P(W)$ and its role as the foundation of language modeling is [Jurafsky & Martin, *Speech and Language Processing* (3rd ed.), Ch. 3 "N-gram Language Models", §3.1](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf) — it follows by induction from the product rule $P(A,B)=P(A)P(B\mid A)$.

> **Note:** this factorization is the heart of **autoregressive** modeling — predict each token from its left context, multiply the conditionals. GPT does *exactly* this; it only replaces the estimator of $P(w_i \mid w_1 \dots w_{i-1})$ with a transformer instead of a count table. Learn the n-gram version and you understand the skeleton of every modern LLM.

But we have only moved the problem, not solved it. The last factor, $P(w_n \mid w_1, \dots, w_{n-1})$, still conditions on the *entire* preceding sentence — a context so long we'll essentially never have seen it before. We need to shorten the history. Enter the Markov assumption.

---

## The Markov assumption turns the chain rule into an n-gram

The **Markov assumption** says: the future depends on only a *bounded* slice of the past. For language: *the probability of the next word depends only on the previous $n-1$ words*, not the whole history.

$$P(w_i \mid w_1, \dots, w_{i-1}) \;\approx\; P(w_i \mid w_{i-n+1}, \dots, w_{i-1}).$$

> **Source / derivation:** the Markov (limited-horizon) approximation and the resulting unigram/bigram/trigram family are [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.1](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf); the framing of language as a finite-order Markov source traces to [Shannon, *A Mathematical Theory of Communication* (1948), §2–3](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf).

Plugging different $n$ gives the model family:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{Unigram } (n{=}1): \quad & P(W) \approx \prod_i P(w_i) \\
\textbf{Bigram } (n{=}2): \quad & P(W) \approx \prod_i P(w_i \mid w_{i-1}) \\
\textbf{Trigram } (n{=}3): \quad & P(W) \approx \prod_i P(w_i \mid w_{i-2}, w_{i-1})
\end{aligned}
$$

The bigram model is the workhorse for teaching: it approximates "given everything so far" by "given just the last word." It's crude — *"the"* surely depends on more than one prior word — but it's *estimable*, because pairs of words recur, whereas whole sentences do not. That is the entire trade: **shorter context = more reliable counts but weaker memory; longer context = sharper predictions but exploding sparsity.** Choosing $n$ is choosing where to sit on that curve.

![A trigram model conditions each word on only the previous two — the Markov window. Here the window (the, cat) predicts "sat"; everything to the left of the window is ignored, which is exactly what makes the counts estimable. As the window slides right, each prediction P(word | previous two) forgets the deeper history.](images/ng_markov_window.png)

> **Tip:** to handle sentence boundaries we pad with special tokens: a start symbol `<s>` (one per order below $n$) and an end symbol `</s>`. The `</s>` is not optional bookkeeping — it lets the model assign probability to *where sentences end*, so that $\sum_W P(W) = 1$ over sequences of *all lengths*. Without `</s>` the distribution wouldn't be normalized across lengths, and the model couldn't prefer "the cat sat ." over the run-on "the cat sat on the …".

## Maximum-likelihood estimation: deriving the count ratio

How do we get the numbers $P(w_i \mid w_{i-1})$? By **maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)**: choose the probabilities that make the training corpus as likely as possible. For a categorical (multinomial) distribution, the MLE is — provably — just **relative frequency**: the count of the event over the count of the conditioning context.

**Deriving the bigram MLE.** We want $P(w_i \mid w_{i-1})$. The conditioning event is "the previous word is $w_{i-1}$"; the joint event is "$w_{i-1}$ followed by $w_i$." By the definition of conditional probability, replacing probabilities with their corpus counts:

$$
P(w_i \mid w_{i-1})
= \frac{P(w_{i-1}, w_i)}{P(w_{i-1})}
= \frac{c(w_{i-1}, w_i)\,/\,T}{c(w_{i-1})\,/\,T}
= \boxed{\;\frac{c(w_{i-1}, w_i)}{c(w_{i-1})}\;}
$$

where $c(\cdot)$ is a corpus count and $T$ is the total token count (which cancels). The general n-gram case is identical with a longer context:

$$P(w_i \mid w_{i-n+1}^{\,i-1}) = \frac{c(w_{i-n+1}^{\,i-1},\, w_i)}{c(w_{i-n+1}^{\,i-1})},$$

using the shorthand $w_a^b = w_a \dots w_b$. **In words: count how often the full n-gram appeared, divide by how often its (n−1)-word prefix appeared.** The denominator $c(w_{i-1})$ equals $\sum_{w} c(w_{i-1}, w)$, so the conditional distribution over the next word sums to 1, as a probability must.

> **Source / derivation:** the bigram/n-gram MLE as a count ratio is [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.1.1](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf). That relative frequency *is* the constrained MLE (not a heuristic) is the standard multinomial result, proved by Lagrange multipliers in [Manning & Schütze, *Foundations of Statistical NLP*, Ch. 6](https://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/).

> **Note:** the formal MLE derivation maximizes the corpus log-likelihood $\sum c(w_{i-1}, w_i) \log p_{w_i \mid w_{i-1}}$ subject to $\sum_{w} p_{w \mid w_{i-1}} = 1$. A Lagrange multiplier gives $p_{w \mid w_{i-1}} \propto c(w_{i-1}, w)$, and normalizing recovers the count ratio. Relative frequency *is* the maximum-likelihood estimate.

> **Note (provenance):** the whole enterprise is older than it looks. **Claude Shannon** (1948, 1951) framed English as a stochastic source and literally played the *"guess the next letter"* game to *measure the entropy of English* — that experiment is the direct ancestor of perplexity. **Fred Jelinek** and the IBM speech group turned n-grams into the engine of statistical speech recognition in the 1970s–80s (his oft-quoted line: *"every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the recognizer goes up"* — counts beat hand-written rules). The smoothing methods below each have a named inventor and year — **Good** (1953), **Katz** (1987), **Kneser & Ney** (1995), with **Chen & Goodman** (1999) running the definitive bake-off — and all are in the references. Knowing *who* introduced *which* fix, and *why*, is exactly the kind of thing a strong interview answer threads through.

### Worked example 1 — a bigram probability by hand

Take the tiny corpus (the classic SLP3 toy, with `<s>`/`</s>` padding):

```
<s> I am Sam </s>
<s> Sam I am </s>
<s> I do not like green eggs and ham </s>
```

Count the unigrams and the bigram we need: `I` appears $c(\text{I}) = 3$ times; the pair `(I, am)` appears $c(\text{I}, \text{am}) = 2$ times (in "I am Sam" and "Sam I am"). So:

$$P(\text{am} \mid \text{I}) = \frac{c(\text{I}, \text{am})}{c(\text{I})} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667.$$

Likewise $P(\text{I} \mid \texttt{<s>}) = \tfrac{2}{3}$ (two of the three sentences start with "I"), $P(\text{Sam} \mid \text{am}) = \tfrac{1}{2}$, and $P(\texttt{</s>} \mid \text{Sam}) = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

### Worked example 2 — a full sentence probability

Now score the sentence `<s> I am Sam </s>` end to end with the bigram chain:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{I am Sam}) &= P(\text{I}\mid\texttt{<s>}) \cdot P(\text{am}\mid\text{I}) \cdot P(\text{Sam}\mid\text{am}) \cdot P(\texttt{</s>}\mid\text{Sam}) \\
&= \tfrac{2}{3} \cdot \tfrac{2}{3} \cdot \tfrac{1}{2} \cdot \tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{4}{36} \approx \mathbf{0.111}.
\end{aligned}
$$

(Both numbers are reproduced by `ngram_lm.py` — `P(am|I)=0.667`, `P(<s> I am Sam </s>)=0.111`.) That is a *complete* n-gram language model evaluation: tokenize, pad, look up each conditional, multiply.

> **Gotcha:** multiplying many probabilities (each $<1$) **underflows** to zero on real-length sentences. Always work in **log space**: $\log P(W) = \sum_i \log P(w_i \mid \text{context})$ — a sum of logs instead of a product of tiny numbers. Every production n-gram (and neural) LM accumulates log-probabilities for exactly this reason.

---

## The catastrophe: one unseen n-gram zeros everything

Here is the flaw that makes raw MLE counts unusable, and the reason half this page exists. The sentence probability is a **product**. If *any single* bigram in it was never seen in training, its count is 0, its probability is 0, and — because anything times zero is zero — **the entire sentence gets probability zero.**

### Worked example 3 — watch a zero destroy a sentence

Using the same toy corpus, score `<s> Sam do not </s>`. The bigram `(Sam, do)` never occurred in training, so:

$$P(\text{do} \mid \text{Sam}) = \frac{c(\text{Sam}, \text{do})}{c(\text{Sam})} = \frac{0}{2} = 0 \;\Longrightarrow\; P(\text{whole sentence}) = 0.$$

The model declares a perfectly grammatical sentence *impossible* purely because one word pair was absent from a small corpus.

![Two sentences scored bigram by bigram. Left: every bigram of "I am Sam" was seen, so the product is a healthy 0.111. Right: "Sam do not" contains the unseen pair (Sam, do) with probability 0 — and because the sentence score is a PRODUCT, that single zero collapses the whole thing to 0. A product is only as strong as its weakest factor.](images/ng_zero_catastrophe.png)

This is the **sparsity / zero-probability problem**, and it is not a small corner case — it's the *typical* case. Language is **Zipfian**: a few words are extremely common and a long tail of words (and most word *pairs*) are rare. Even a billion-word corpus is missing the overwhelming majority of plausible bigrams and trigrams.

![Word frequencies on a corpus follow Zipf's law: ranked by frequency, the curve is a near-straight line on log-log axes (frequency ∝ 1/rank). A handful of words ("the", "cat") dominate; a long tail occurs once or twice. Because rare words are common, rare PAIRS of them are overwhelmingly common — which is why most grammatical n-grams are simply never observed, and why smoothing is mandatory, not optional.](images/ng_zipf.png)

Two consequences:

1. **Zeros everywhere.** Unseen n-grams get $P = 0$, so any test sentence containing one is assigned zero probability — and you can't take $\log 0 = -\infty$, so **perplexity blows up to infinity.** The model is unusable for evaluation.
2. **Overconfidence on what *was* seen.** Because the unseen mass is wrongly assigned to seen events, the seen estimates are systematically too high.

The cure is **smoothing**: take a little probability mass away from the events we *did* see (discounting) and redistribute it to the events we *didn't*. The rest of the page is a ladder of increasingly clever ways to do exactly that.

## Smoothing ladder, rung 1: Laplace (add-one)

The simplest possible fix, due to Laplace: **pretend you saw every possible n-gram one extra time.** Add 1 to every count before normalizing. For a bigram with vocabulary size $V$:

$$P_{\text{Laplace}}(w_i \mid w_{i-1}) = \frac{c(w_{i-1}, w_i) + 1}{c(w_{i-1}) + V}.$$

> **Source / derivation:** add-one (Laplace) smoothing for n-grams, including why $V$ enters the denominator, is [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.5.1](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf). It is the Bayesian posterior mean under a symmetric Dirichlet/Beta prior with pseudo-count 1, treated as a baseline in [Chen & Goodman (1999)](https://aclanthology.org/J99-1004/).

**Why does $V$ appear in the denominator?** Because the distribution must still sum to 1. We added 1 to the count of *each* of the $V$ possible next words, so we added $V$ in total to the numerator-sum — and the denominator must grow by the same $V$ to keep $\sum_{w} P_{\text{Laplace}}(w \mid w_{i-1}) = 1$. The denominator is the *original* context count $c(w_{i-1})$ plus the $V$ pseudo-counts we sprinkled across the vocabulary. Derive it once and you'll never misremember it:

$$\sum_{w \in V} \frac{c(w_{i-1}, w) + 1}{c(w_{i-1}) + V} = \frac{\sum_w c(w_{i-1}, w) + V}{c(w_{i-1}) + V} = \frac{c(w_{i-1}) + V}{c(w_{i-1}) + V} = 1. \;\checkmark$$

### Worked example 4 — Laplace rescues the zero

Back to the unseen `(Sam, do)`. The toy vocabulary has $V = 12$ types (10 content words + `<s>` + `</s>`, the SLP3 convention) and $c(\text{Sam}) = 2$. MLE gave 0; Laplace gives:

$$P_{\text{Laplace}}(\text{do} \mid \text{Sam}) = \frac{0 + 1}{2 + 12} = \frac{1}{14} \approx \mathbf{0.071}.$$

Nonzero — the sentence is no longer impossible. (Verified: `P(do | Sam) Laplace = 0.0714`.) The same formula *discounts* the seen events: $P_{\text{Laplace}}(\text{am}\mid\text{I}) = \frac{2+1}{3+12} = \frac{3}{15} = 0.2$, down from the MLE's 0.667. That collapse is the problem.

> **Gotcha:** Laplace is **far too aggressive** for language. With a realistic $V$ of tens of thousands, the "$+V$" in the denominator dwarfs $c(w_{i-1})$ for most contexts, so almost all the probability mass is shoved onto the (enormous) set of unseen events, and the seen, *informative* bigrams are starved. It's a fine teaching device and a fine prior for small, dense problems — but a poor smoother for sparse text. Real systems need methods that move only the *right amount* of mass.

The figure below shows this concretely on our measured corpus: for the context "the", MLE (red) gives zero to genuinely-unseen continuations like "the rabbit" (the zero cliff, arrow), Laplace (amber) lifts them off zero but flattens the seen estimates, and Kneser-Ney (green) — the rung we're climbing toward — keeps the seen distribution sharp while still reserving sensible mass for the unseen.

![Next-word probability after "the" under MLE vs Laplace vs Kneser-Ney on the measured corpus. MLE assigns exactly zero to the unseen continuation "the rabbit" (the zero cliff, arrowed). Laplace lifts the unseen off zero but flattens the seen words ("the cat"/"the dog" drop from ~0.27 to ~0.16). Kneser-Ney keeps the seen distribution sharp (cat/dog stay near 0.24) while still reserving sensible mass for the unseen.](images/ng_smoothing_mass.png)

---

## Rung 2: add-k

The obvious patch to Laplace's over-smoothing is to add a *fraction* $k$ (e.g. $k = 0.05$) instead of a whole count:

$$P_{\text{add-}k}(w_i \mid w_{i-1}) = \frac{c(w_{i-1}, w_i) + k}{c(w_{i-1}) + kV}.$$

> **Source / derivation:** add-k (Lidstone) smoothing and the practice of tuning $k$ on a held-out set are [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.5.2](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf); its weakness relative to discounting methods is documented in [Chen & Goodman (1999)](https://aclanthology.org/J99-1004/).

With $k < 1$ you move less mass to the unseen events. You can even tune $k$ on a held-out set. But add-k inherits Laplace's fundamental defect: it spreads mass **uniformly** over all unseen n-grams, treating "I am Francisco" and "I am happy" as equally plausible unseen continuations. Language isn't uniform — some unseen events are far likelier than others. To do better we must look at *which kinds* of events go unseen, which is what Good-Turing and Kneser-Ney exploit.

---

## Rung 3: Good-Turing — let the singletons estimate the unseen

Good-Turing (Alan Turing & I.J. Good, WWII codebreaking) introduces a beautiful idea: **use the count of things seen $r{+}1$ times to re-estimate things seen $r$ times.** Define $N_r$ = the number of distinct n-gram types that occur exactly $r$ times (the "frequency of frequencies"). The Good-Turing *reestimated* count is:

$$c^{*} = (c + 1)\,\frac{N_{c+1}}{N_c}.$$

> **Source / derivation:** the Good-Turing estimator and the $N_1/N$ missing-mass result originate with [I. J. Good, *The Population Frequencies of Species and the Estimation of Population Parameters* (1953)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2333344); the LM-facing treatment used here is [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.5.3 (and the "Advanced: Good-Turing" section)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).

**The idea, derived intuitively.** How much total probability should we have reserved for events we saw $r{+}1$ times? In a held-out sample, the events we'll see $r{+}1$ times are well-modeled by the events we saw $r$ times in training — Good-Turing borrows that bridge to *discount* each count toward the next-lower frequency band. The most important special case is $r = 0$: the events we've **never** seen.

**The missing mass for unseen events.** Set the reestimated count for unseen events ($r = 0$): the total probability mass that should be reserved for *all* zero-count events is

$$P_{\text{GT}}(\text{unseen}) = \frac{N_1}{N},$$

where $N_1$ is the number of n-grams seen **exactly once** and $N$ is the total number of n-gram tokens. **Read that:** the fraction of probability you should hold back for things you've never seen is estimated by the fraction of your data that occurred *just once*. It's intuitive — a corpus full of singletons is a corpus still discovering new events, so reserve a lot; a corpus where everything repeats has likely seen most of its vocabulary, so reserve little.

![Frequency of frequencies N_r on the measured corpus's bigrams: a tall spike at count 1 (most bigram types occur exactly once) decaying fast. Good-Turing's estimate of the probability mass to reserve for unseen bigrams is N₁/N — here 14/78 ≈ 0.18, almost a fifth of the mass — read straight off the height of the N₁ bar.](images/ng_freq_of_freqs.png)

On this corpus the singleton band $N_1 = 14$ dominates, and $N_1/N = 14/78 \approx \mathbf{0.18}$ — almost a fifth of the mass belongs to the unseen. The *count of singletons* turns out to be the best estimate of how much probability mass we should reserve for things we've **never** seen; that single insight is what every later method inherits.

### A Good-Turing reestimate by hand

Read the frequency-of-frequencies straight off the bar chart: on this corpus $N_1 = 14$ (14 bigram types seen exactly once), $N_2 = 12$, $N_3 = 5$. The Good-Turing reestimated count for a bigram we saw **once** is

$$c^{*}(1) = (1 + 1)\,\frac{N_2}{N_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{12}{14} \approx \mathbf{1.71}.$$

(Verified: `c*(1)=1.71`.) The reestimated count for a bigram we saw **twice** drops below 2 as well, $c^{*}(2) = 3 \cdot N_3/N_2 = 3 \cdot 5/12 = 1.25$ — every seen count is shaved downward, and the **mass shaved off, summed across all those events, is exactly what funds the unseen.** That is discounting and redistribution in a single line of arithmetic.

![Three ways to reestimate a seen count, on the measured corpus's bigrams: the dashed slate line is the raw count c (no discount); absolute discounting subtracts a fixed d=0.75 (the clean green line, c−d, parallel below the diagonal); Good-Turing c* (amber) is JAGGED — on this tiny corpus it can sit ABOVE the raw count at r=1 (here c*(1)=1.71, because N₂≈N₁ so the band is unusually full), and where a frequency band is empty (N_r undefined) it falls back to the raw c. N_r is noisy at low and high counts. That jaggedness is exactly why raw Good-Turing needs the N_r smoothed first, and why absolute discounting became the practical favorite.](images/ng_discount_curves.png)

> **Gotcha:** raw Good-Turing is unstable for large $r$ because $N_r$ becomes 0 or tiny in the tail (you might have *no* n-gram seen exactly 7 times, making $N_7$ zero and $N_8/N_7$ undefined). Practical Good-Turing **smooths the $N_r$** (e.g. fits a log-log line) before applying the formula — the jaggedness is visible as the amber curve above. Its conceptual gift, $N_1/N$ for the missing mass, is what later methods inherit.

---

## Rung 4: Katz backoff — drop to a shorter n-gram

Smoothing-by-discounting still spreads the reserved mass uniformly. **Backoff** spends it more wisely: *if you have no evidence for the full n-gram, fall back to the shorter one you do have evidence for.* Katz backoff:

$$
P_{\text{katz}}(w_i \mid w_{i-n+1}^{\,i-1}) =

In words: **if the trigram was seen, use a discounted trigram estimate $P^{*}$; if not, *back off* to the bigram (and the bigram to the unigram), scaled by a context-specific weight $\alpha$.** Two pieces make it valid:

- **Discount $P^{*}$.** The seen-n-gram estimate is discounted (Katz uses Good-Turing) to free up mass — otherwise there'd be nothing to give the backed-off events.
- **The back-off weight $\alpha$.** $\alpha(\text{context})$ is set precisely so that the freed mass is distributed over the *unseen* words in proportion to the lower-order model, **and the whole conditional distribution still sums to 1.** $\alpha$ is "how much mass did discounting free up here, normalized over the lower-order distribution restricted to the unseen words."

So Katz uses the *full* n-gram where it has data and gracefully degrades to shorter contexts where it doesn't — instead of pretending all unseen events are equal.

## Rung 5: linear interpolation — always mix all orders

Backoff uses the higher-order model **or** the lower one. **Interpolation** uses them **all the time, blended.** The simple linear (deleted) interpolation of a trigram model:

$$
\hat{P}(w_i \mid w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}) =
\lambda_3\, P(w_i \mid w_{i-2}, w_{i-1})
+ \lambda_2\, P(w_i \mid w_{i-1})
+ \lambda_1\, P(w_i),
$$

with $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1$ and each $\lambda \ge 0$ (so the result is a valid distribution).

> **Source / derivation:** linear (deleted) interpolation and fitting the $\lambda$'s on held-out data via EM are [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.6](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf); the held-out interpolation idea traces to the IBM line, [Brown et al. (1992)](https://aclanthology.org/J92-4003/) and the references therein.

The intuition: **every prediction is a weighted vote between the sharp-but-sparse trigram, the steadier bigram, and the always-available unigram.** When the trigram has plenty of evidence, you want $\lambda_3$ large; when it's data-starved, lean on the lower orders.

**Where do the $\lambda$'s come from?** You *cannot* fit them on the training data (the trigram would always win there — it overfits). You fit them on a **held-out** set: freeze the n-gram counts from training, then choose the $\lambda$'s that **maximize the likelihood of the held-out data** (typically via the EM algorithm, or context-dependent $\lambda$'s bucketed by how much evidence each context has). This held-out fitting is the same "use a separate set to tune the thing that controls generalization" idea you'll see in every regularization method.

**A worked interpolation step.** Suppose for the context "I am" we have trigram $P(\text{Sam} \mid \text{I, am}) = 0.5$, the backed-off bigram $P(\text{Sam} \mid \text{am}) = 0.5$, and the unigram $P(\text{Sam}) = 0.1$, with tuned weights $\lambda_3 = 0.6,\ \lambda_2 = 0.3,\ \lambda_1 = 0.1$. Then

$$\hat P(\text{Sam} \mid \text{I, am}) = 0.6(0.5) + 0.3(0.5) + 0.1(0.1) = 0.30 + 0.15 + 0.01 = \mathbf{0.46}.$$

Notice the unigram term is small but **nonzero** — so even a context the trigram and bigram both missed can never collapse to probability zero. The blend *guarantees* a floor while still letting the sharp higher orders dominate when they have evidence.

> **Tip:** backoff vs. interpolation is a classic interview contrast. **Backoff** consults the lower-order model *only when the higher-order count is zero*; **interpolation** *always* mixes them. Interpolation is usually a touch better and simpler to implement, and — crucially — it's the framework in which **Kneser-Ney**, the best classical smoother, is expressed.

---

## Rung 6: Kneser-Ney — the gold standard

Kneser-Ney (Kneser & Ney 1995, refined by Chen & Goodman 1998) is the **best-performing classical n-gram smoother**, and the empirical winner of Chen & Goodman's exhaustive study. It combines two ideas: **absolute discounting** and a clever **continuation probability** for the lower-order model.

> **Source / derivation:** Kneser-Ney smoothing — absolute discounting plus the continuation (lower-order) distribution based on distinct preceding contexts — is [Reinhard Kneser & Hermann Ney, *Improved Backing-off for M-gram Language Modeling* (1995)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/479394). *Modified* Kneser-Ney (the three-discount refinement) and the bake-off that crowned it are [Stanley Chen & Joshua Goodman, *An Empirical Study of Smoothing Techniques for Language Modeling* (1999)](https://aclanthology.org/J99-1004/); the worked formulae here follow [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.7](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).

### Part A — absolute discounting

Instead of multiplying counts down, just **subtract a fixed discount $d$** (typically $0 < d < 1$, often $\approx 0.75$) from every nonzero count, and hand the freed mass to a lower-order model:

$$
P_{\text{AD}}(w_i \mid w_{i-1}) =
\frac{\max\!\big(c(w_{i-1}, w_i) - d,\; 0\big)}{c(w_{i-1})}
\;+\; \lambda(w_{i-1})\, P_{\text{lower}}(w_i).
$$

Why subtract a *constant*? Chen & Goodman observed empirically that a bigram seen $c$ times in training tends to appear about $c - 0.75$ times in held-out data — the "held-out count" is consistently a hair below the training count, and that gap is roughly constant across $c$ (you can see this in the discounting figure above: the green absolute-discount line runs *parallel* to the raw-count diagonal). So absolute discounting is the empirically-calibrated discount, not an arbitrary one. The freed mass per context is $\lambda(w_{i-1}) = \frac{d}{c(w_{i-1})} \cdot |\{w : c(w_{i-1}, w) > 0\}|$ — the discount $d$ times the number of distinct words that followed $w_{i-1}$, normalized — which is exactly the total mass we shaved off, so the distribution still sums to 1.

### Part B — the continuation probability (the real insight)

Here's the move that makes Kneser-Ney special. When we back off to the lower-order (unigram) model, the *naive* choice $P_{\text{lower}}(w) = P(w)$ (raw unigram frequency) is **wrong**, and a single example shows why.

Consider the word **"Francisco."** It's reasonably frequent in many corpora — but it appears almost **only** after one word: "San." So if our bigram fails and we back off to the unigram, raw frequency would assign "Francisco" a *high* probability in *every* context — predicting "Francisco" after "the", "reading", "glass" — which is nonsense. "Francisco" is frequent but **not versatile**: it completes very few distinct contexts.

Kneser-Ney's fix: replace raw unigram frequency with the **continuation probability** — *how many distinct contexts does this word complete?*

$$P_{\text{cont}}(w) = \frac{\big|\{\,v : c(v, w) > 0\,\}\big|}{\big|\{(v', w') : c(v', w') > 0\}\big|} = \frac{\text{\# distinct words that precede } w}{\text{\# distinct bigram types}}.$$

The numerator counts the **distinct preceding words** (distinct contexts $w$ can follow); the denominator normalizes over all bigram types. By this measure, "Francisco" scores *low* (only "San" precedes it), while a versatile word like "the" scores high (it follows almost everything). So when the model backs off, it predicts words that **fit many contexts**, not words that are merely frequent. That single substitution — **frequency → versatility** — is the bulk of Kneser-Ney's empirical win.

### Worked example 5 — continuation probabilities by hand

On the toy corpus, count distinct preceders (there are 15 distinct bigram types at bigram order):

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{\text{cont}}(\text{am}) &= \tfrac{1}{15} = 0.067 \quad(\text{only "I" precedes "am"}) \\
P_{\text{cont}}(\text{Sam}) &= \tfrac{2}{15} = 0.133 \quad(\text{"<s>" and "am" precede it}) \\
P_{\text{cont}}(\texttt{</s>}) &= \tfrac{3}{15} = 0.200 \quad(\text{"am", "ham", "Sam" precede it})
\end{aligned}
$$

(All three verified by `continuation_counts_bigram` in `ngram_lm.py`.) Even on three sentences, the *versatile* sentence-ender `</s>` (preceded by three different words) outscores the *narrow* "am" (preceded by only one) — exactly the "Francisco" effect in miniature.

### Interpolated and modified Kneser-Ney

The standard form is **interpolated** Kneser-Ney (mix, don't switch): the absolute-discounting equation above *always* adds the continuation term. **Modified Kneser-Ney** (Chen & Goodman) refines it further by using **three** different discounts — $d_1, d_2, d_{3+}$ for n-grams seen once, twice, and three-or-more times — because the optimal discount isn't quite constant across low counts. Modified KN is the version you'll see in toolkits (SRILM, KenLM) and the one that held the language-modeling crown until neural LMs.

> **Note:** the recursion is the same at every order: a trigram absolute-discounts to an interpolated *bigram* KN model, which discounts to a *unigram* continuation model. Continuation counts replace raw counts at **every** lower order, not just the unigram floor. (This is exactly what `KneserNeyOrderN` in the code does — one recursive `prob(w, ctx)` that drops the oldest word and recurses until it hits the unigram continuation floor.)

## Perplexity: deriving the standard evaluation metric

How do you *score* a language model? Not by accuracy (there's no single right next word) but by **how surprised it is by held-out text** — a good model assigns *high probability* to real sentences it didn't train on. The standard metric is **perplexity**.

**Derivation.** Start from the probability the model assigns to a held-out sequence $W = w_1 \dots w_N$. We want a per-word, length-normalized measure (so we can compare a 10-word and a 1000-word test set), so take the **geometric mean** of the per-word probabilities and invert it:

$$
\mathrm{PP}(W)
= P(w_1, \dots, w_N)^{-\frac{1}{N}}
= \sqrt[N]{\frac{1}{P(w_1, \dots, w_N)}}
= \left(\prod_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{P(w_i \mid \text{context})}\right)^{\!\frac{1}{N}}.
$$

The inverse and the root are deliberate: **lower perplexity = higher probability = better model.** To compute it stably, move to logs (base 2):

$$
\mathrm{PP}(W)
= 2^{\,-\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log_2 P(w_i \mid \text{context})}
= 2^{\,H(W)},
$$

where $H(W) = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \log_2 P(w_i \mid \text{context})$ is the **cross-entropy** (in bits per word) of the held-out text under the model. **So perplexity is just two-to-the-cross-entropy** — the two metrics are the same information, one in bits and one as a "branching factor."

> **Source / derivation:** perplexity as the inverse-geometric-mean probability and its identity with $2^{\text{cross-entropy}}$ are [Jurafsky & Martin, SLP3 Ch. 3, §3.2–3.3](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf); the entropy/cross-entropy foundation and the "branching factor" reading trace to [Shannon (1948), §1 (entropy) and the *Prediction and Entropy of Printed English* follow-up (1951)](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf).

> **Note:** the **branching-factor** reading is the one to say out loud. A perplexity of $k$ means the model is, on average, as confused as if it had to choose **uniformly among $k$ equally-likely words** at each step. Perplexity 1 = perfect (it always knew the next word); perplexity = $V$ = no better than uniform random guessing over the whole vocabulary. A bigram model on English news might score ~150; a good neural LM far lower. **Lower is better, always.**

### Worked example 6 — perplexity by hand

Score the held-out `<s> I am Sam </s>` under the Laplace bigram model ($V = 12$). Its four bigram probabilities (each $(c+1)/(c(\text{prev}) + 12)$) work out so that the per-word cross-entropy gives:

$$\mathrm{PP} = 2^{-\frac14 \sum_{i=1}^{4} \log_2 P(w_i \mid w_{i-1})} \approx \mathbf{5.92}.$$

(Verified: `Laplace PP (toy sentence) = 5.916` over 4 bigrams.) Interpreted: on this tiny vocabulary the smoothed model is about as uncertain as a uniform choice among ~6 words at each step — reasonable for so little data.

> **Gotcha:** perplexity is **only comparable across models with the same vocabulary and the same tokenization.** Change the vocab (e.g. add `<UNK>`, or switch to subword tokens) and the per-word denominator changes, so the numbers aren't comparable. This is exactly why modern LLM papers report perplexity *per the same tokenizer*, or switch to **bits-per-byte** to compare across tokenizations.

---

## OOV and the `<UNK>` token

Real test text contains words that never appeared in training — **out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words. A closed-vocabulary model would assign them probability zero (back to the catastrophe). The standard fix is an explicit **unknown-word token `<UNK>`**:

1. **Fix the vocabulary** — e.g. keep the top-$V$ most frequent words, or all words with count $\ge t$.
2. **Replace** every other training word (and every test word not in the vocabulary) with `<UNK>`.
3. **Train normally** — `<UNK>` now has real counts and a real probability, so OOV test words get a sane, nonzero probability via the `<UNK>` slot.

> **Gotcha:** like perplexity, the choice of vocabulary (and thus how much text becomes `<UNK>`) silently changes the score — a smaller vocabulary funnels more mass into `<UNK>` and *lowers* perplexity artificially. Always compare models under an identical vocabulary/UNK policy. Subword tokenization (BPE) later sidesteps OOV entirely by decomposing unknown words into known pieces — another idea n-grams motivated.

---

## A measured n-gram model: train, evaluate, generate

Time to make all of this real. The measured plots on this page come from a from-scratch interpolated-Kneser-Ney model trained on a small corpus. Two findings, both visible below.

**Perplexity vs $n$.** Going from unigram → bigram **slashes** perplexity (from ~12.9 to ~5.9) as soon as the model can use *any* context; pushing to trigram barely helps (5.74) and 4-gram even ticks *up* (5.99) on this tiny corpus, because higher orders are starved for counts. On a *large* corpus the curve keeps descending with $n$ (up to a point) — this is the **bias–variance turn** of context length, made visible.

![Held-out perplexity vs model order n under interpolated Kneser-Ney. A sharp drop from unigram (12.92) to bigram (5.87) as the model gains context, a marginal further drop to the trigram minimum (5.74), then a tick UP at 4-gram (5.99) as higher orders run out of counts on this small corpus. The dip-then-rise is the bias–variance trade-off of context length: more context lowers bias but raises variance once the counts go sparse.](images/ng_perplexity_vs_n.png)

> **Note:** this curve uses the general arbitrary-order `KneserNeyOrderN` so all four points come from one consistent smoother; its $n{=}3$ point (5.74) differs by a hair from the standalone `KneserNeyTrigram` headline above (5.78) only because the two count sentence-boundary `<s>` markers slightly differently — the same model, two boundary conventions, both ≈ 5.8. Tiny boundary choices like this are exactly why perplexity is only comparable *within* one fixed setup.

**Perplexity vs training size and smoother.** With the full training set, **Kneser-Ney (5.87) beats Laplace (8.22)** — and the KN curve sits below Laplace and descends faster as data grows, because its continuation-probability backoff makes better use of scarce counts. (At the smallest data slice the curves cross — a small-corpus artifact where add-one's heavy uniform prior briefly helps; on real corpora KN dominates throughout.)

![Held-out bigram perplexity vs the fraction of training data used, for Laplace (add-1) vs Kneser-Ney. KN (green) ends well below Laplace (amber) at full data (5.87 vs 8.22) and falls faster as data grows. At the smallest 30% slice the curves cross — a small-corpus artifact where add-one's heavy uniform prior briefly helps — but KN dominates everywhere there is real data.](images/ng_perplexity_vs_data.png)

> **Note:** the generated text is locally plausible (each transition is a real bigram/trigram the model saw) but globally aimless — it never plans past two words. That is the n-gram model's signature: **plausible local transitions, no long-range coherence.** Watching it generate is the fastest way to *feel* the Markov assumption's ceiling. (For a production-grade build, the same logic trained with `nltk.lm.KneserNeyInterpolated` or **KenLM** on a real corpus gives much lower perplexity — but identical structure.)

> **Try it:** before you change anything, **predict**: if you raise the discount `d` from 0.75 toward 0.95, does held-out perplexity go up, down, or stay flat? (Hint: a larger `d` shaves *more* mass off every seen count and hands it to the continuation model — good when the seen counts are noisy, bad when they're reliable. On this tiny, repetitive corpus the seen trigrams are fairly trustworthy, so over-discounting should *hurt*.) Change `DEFAULT_DISCOUNT` in `ngram_lm.py` and re-run to check.

---

## Pitfalls and failure modes

The things that actually bite when you build or evaluate an n-gram LM:

- **Multiplying probabilities underflows.** A 30-word sentence multiplies 30 numbers each $\ll 1$; in float64 the product underflows to exactly 0 and you lose the score. **Fix:** accumulate $\sum_i \log_2 P$ and exponentiate at the end (every `perplexity()` here does this). Forgetting it silently reports perplexity $\infty$ on long sentences.
- **The off-by-one in padding.** An order-$n$ model needs **$n-1$** `<s>` markers, not $n$ and not 1. Pad with one `<s>` for a trigram and the first real word has only a one-word context — a different model. **Fix:** `pad(s, n) = [BOS]*(n-1) + s + [EOS]`, and the EOS is mandatory (it's what normalizes across lengths).
- **Fitting interpolation weights on the training set.** The trigram always wins on training data (it memorizes), so training-fit $\lambda$'s overfit catastrophically. **Fix:** fit $\lambda$ (and tune $k$, $d$) on a *separate held-out* set — the same discipline as any hyperparameter.
- **Comparing perplexities across different vocabularies/tokenizers.** A smaller vocab or a coarser tokenizer mechanically lowers perplexity without the model being better, because the per-word denominator changed. **Fix:** only compare under an identical vocab + UNK policy, or report **bits-per-byte**.
- **Raw Good-Turing in the tail.** $N_{r+1}/N_r$ is undefined when a frequency band is empty (no n-gram seen exactly $r{+}1$ times) — common at higher $r$. **Fix:** smooth the $N_r$ (fit a log-log line) before applying the formula, or use absolute discounting, which sidesteps the issue.
- **Treating the continuation probability as a frequency.** The single most common Kneser-Ney bug is backing off to raw unigram $P(w)$ instead of $P_{\text{cont}}(w)$ — this is precisely the "Francisco" mistake and it quietly costs most of KN's advantage. **Fix:** the lower-order model counts *distinct preceding contexts*, not occurrences.

> **Gotcha:** the math says "subtract $d$ then add $\lambda\,P_{\text{lower}}$"; the code must also handle the *unseen-context* case ($c(\text{context})=0$), where there's nothing to discount and you back off entirely. Miss that branch and you divide by zero. Both `p_bigram` and `p_trigram` above guard it with the `if cc == 0` early return.

---

## Where n-grams are still used

It would be a mistake to file n-grams under "obsolete." They are tiny, transparent, and *blisteringly* fast — no GPU, no training loop, just count tables and a lookup — so they remain the right tool wherever those properties matter:

- **On-device and low-latency** autocomplete, predictive keyboards, and query completion, where a neural model is too heavy or too slow.
- **Speech recognition and machine translation rescoring** — large n-gram LMs (trained with KenLM/SRILM, often modified Kneser-Ney) still rescore candidate hypotheses inside many production ASR/MT pipelines, sometimes *combined* with a neural LM.
- **Feature engineering and classification** — character- and word-n-gram features feed classic text classifiers (spam, language ID, authorship), where they're cheap and surprisingly strong.
- **Baselines and sanity checks** — when you build *any* new LM, an n-gram perplexity is the baseline you must beat; if your fancy model can't outscore a trigram, something is wrong.
- **Teaching the objective** — as this page argues, they're the clearest place to *see* the chain rule, smoothing, and perplexity before those ideas hide inside a transformer.

> **Tip:** **KenLM** is the workhorse you'll meet in practice — it trains modified-Kneser-Ney n-gram models over billions of tokens in minutes and serves them with a memory-mapped, quantized data structure. Reach for it (not a from-scratch dict) the moment you need a *real* n-gram LM.

## In production: how real n-gram LMs are built and served

The from-scratch model above is for understanding; a production n-gram LM looks different in three ways worth knowing:

- **Toolkits, not dicts.** **KenLM** (Heafield) and **SRILM** (Stolcke) are the standard trainers. KenLM estimates **modified Kneser-Ney** in a streaming pass over the corpus (it never holds all counts in RAM), then serves the model from a **memory-mapped trie** so a multi-gigabyte LM loads instantly and is shared across processes. SRILM is the research-flexible counterpart (more smoothers, more knobs).
- **Quantization and pruning for scale.** A 5-gram LM over web text has billions of entries. Production builds **prune** low-count n-grams (entropy- or count-thresholded) and **quantize** the stored probabilities/back-off weights to 8–10 bits, trading a sliver of perplexity for an order-of-magnitude smaller, faster model — the same bytes-vs-quality tradeoff you meet again in LLM quantization.
- **As a component, not the whole system.** In modern ASR/MT the n-gram LM is one **rescoring** stage: a first-pass decoder produces a lattice or n-best list, and the big Kneser-Ney LM (often *interpolated* with a neural LM) reranks it. The n-gram model contributes fluency cheaply; the neural model contributes long-range coherence. Knowing the n-gram half is what lets you reason about the combined score.

> **Tip:** if an interviewer asks "how would you add a language model to a speech recognizer on a tight latency budget," the strong answer is: *train a pruned, quantized modified-Kneser-Ney n-gram LM with KenLM, memory-map it, and use it to rescore the decoder's n-best list — optionally interpolated with a small neural LM.* Every clause is a concept from this page.

## Why n-grams hit a wall (and what came next)

N-gram models taught the field everything, then ran into three hard limits that no amount of smoothing can fix — and each limit named the feature its successor had to provide:

1. **No memory beyond $n$.** A trigram cannot connect "The **dog** that chased the cat across three yards … was **tired**" — the subject and verb are too far apart for any feasible window. Raising $n$ doesn't help: **sparsity explodes**. The number of possible n-grams is $V^n$; at $V \approx 50{,}000$, there are $1.25 \times 10^{14}$ possible trigrams and you'll have seen a vanishing fraction. Longer context = exponentially emptier count tables.
2. **No generalization / no semantics.** This is the deepest flaw. To an n-gram model, every word is an **atomic, unrelated symbol**. Having seen "the **blue** car" tells it *nothing* about "the **green** car" — "blue" and "green" are as unrelated as "blue" and "throne." There's no notion that words have *meaning* or *similarity*, so knowledge never transfers between related contexts. The model can only ever regurgitate combinations it literally observed.
3. **Storage and scale.** Count tables for high-order n-grams over web-scale corpora are enormous, and most entries are singletons — a huge, sparse, brittle artifact.

The fixes for these limits *are* the next several pages of NLP. The cure for (2) — give words **dense vectors** so that "blue" and "green" sit near each other and knowledge transfers — is **word embeddings** ([Word Embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/word-embeddings-word2vec-glove-fasttext/word-embeddings-word2vec-glove-fasttext)), which grew directly out of the **distributional hypothesis** that n-gram counting hints at. The cure for (1) — a model that carries information across long spans and *learns* (rather than counts) the conditional $P(w_i \mid \text{context})$ — is the **neural language model**, first with RNNs/LSTMs and then, decisively, with the **transformer** ([Sequence-to-Sequence & Encoder–Decoder](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/sequence-to-sequence-and-encoder-decoder/sequence-to-sequence-and-encoder-decoder), and the decoder-only LLMs that followed). But every one of those neural models still optimizes the **same chain-rule, same cross-entropy, same perplexity** you derived here — n-grams are not obsolete trivia, they're the **conceptual base class** every modern LM inherits from.

> **Tip:** the cleanest one-line summary for an interview: *"N-grams approximate $P(\text{next} \mid \text{history})$ by **counting** within a fixed window; neural LMs approximate the same quantity by **learning** a function over a dense, unbounded-context representation — same objective, infinitely better estimator."*

## Recap and rapid-fire

**If you remember nothing else:** a language model factorizes a sentence's probability by the **chain rule**, the **Markov assumption** truncates the history to the last $n{-}1$ words (the **n-gram**), and **MLE** estimates each conditional as a **count ratio** $c(\text{context}, w)/c(\text{context})$. Raw counts assign **zero** to any unseen n-gram — zeroing whole sentences — so we **smooth**: discount seen events and redistribute the mass, climbing from **Laplace** → **add-k** → **Good-Turing** → **Katz backoff** → **interpolation** → **Kneser-Ney** (the gold standard, via absolute discounting + continuation probabilities). We score with **perplexity** = $2^{\text{cross-entropy}}$, the model's average branching factor (**lower is better**). N-grams die on **long-range dependency, sparsity, and lack of semantics** — which is precisely what embeddings and neural LMs were built to fix.

**Quick-fire — say these out loud:**

- *What's the chain rule for $P(W)$?* $\prod_i P(w_i \mid w_1 \dots w_{i-1})$ — exact, no approximation.
- *What does the Markov assumption do?* Truncates the history to the last $n{-}1$ words: $P(w_i \mid w_{i-n+1}^{\,i-1})$.
- *Bigram MLE formula?* $c(w_{i-1}, w_i) / c(w_{i-1})$ — the count ratio is the maximum-likelihood estimate.
- *Why do we need smoothing?* Unseen n-grams get probability 0, which zeros whole sentences and makes perplexity infinite.
- *Why is there a $+V$ in Laplace's denominator?* We added 1 to each of $V$ next-words, so we added $V$ total — the denominator must match to keep $\sum P = 1$.
- *Good-Turing missing mass for unseen events?* $N_1 / N$ — the fraction of singletons estimates the unseen mass.
- *Backoff vs. interpolation?* Backoff uses the lower order *only when the higher count is 0*; interpolation *always* mixes all orders.
- *What's Kneser-Ney's key idea?* Absolute discounting **plus** a **continuation probability** — back off to *how many distinct contexts a word completes*, not its raw frequency. ("Francisco" is frequent but completes only "San ___", so its continuation prob is low.)
- *Define perplexity.* $\mathrm{PP}(W) = P(W)^{-1/N} = 2^{\text{cross-entropy}}$ — the average branching factor; lower is better.
- *Why did n-grams lose?* No long-range memory (sparsity explodes with $n$) and no semantic generalization ("blue car" tells it nothing about "green car") → embeddings + neural LMs.
