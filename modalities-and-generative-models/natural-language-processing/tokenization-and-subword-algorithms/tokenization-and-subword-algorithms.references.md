# Tokenization & Subword Algorithms — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Tokenization & Subword Algorithms](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/tokenization-and-subword-algorithms/tokenization-and-subword-algorithms)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author (the paper's authors) or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Let's build the GPT Tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) (**Andrej Karpathy**). *Implements byte-level BPE from scratch; the single best resource for making tokenization stick.*
2. **See the algorithms side by side** — read [Summary of the tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tokenizer_summary) (**Hugging Face**). *Crisp contrast of BPE vs WordPiece vs Unigram, fully open.*
3. **Walk the merges** — work through [Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/en/chapter6/5) (**Hugging Face course**). *A numeric BPE training example you can redo by hand.*
4. **Read the source** — read [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909) (**Sennrich et al., 2016**). *The paper that brought BPE to NLP.*
5. **Connect to the probabilistic view** — read [Subword Regularization (Unigram LM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10959) (**Kudo, 2018**). *The probabilistic alternative to merge-based tokenization.*

**Videos**:
