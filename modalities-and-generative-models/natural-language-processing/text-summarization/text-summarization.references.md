# Text Summarization — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Text Summarization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/text-summarization/text-summarization)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame the two paradigms** — watch [What is Text Summarization? Extractive & Abstractive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEikjJ6c63A) (**OnTimeNotes**). *The select-vs-generate distinction before any model.*
2. **See extractive ranking** — read the [TextRank paper](https://aclanthology.org/W04-3252/) (**Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004**). *PageRank-on-sentences — simple, unsupervised, still strong.*
3. **Get abstractive copying** — read [Get To The Point (Pointer-Generator)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04368) (**See, Liu & Manning, 2017**). *The $p_{gen}$ copy/generate switch + coverage that fix OOV and repetition.*
4. **Read the modern backbones** — skim [PEGASUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08777) and [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461). *Pretraining objectives built for (or ideal for) summarization.*
5. **Confront evaluation** — read [On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00661) (**Maynez et al., 2020**). *Why ROUGE isn't enough and hallucination is the real problem.*
6. **Make it concrete** — code it with the [Hugging Face Summarization guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/summarization). *Fine-tune and evaluate with ROUGE.*
