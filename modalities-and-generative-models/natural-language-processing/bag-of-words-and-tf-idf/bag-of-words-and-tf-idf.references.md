# Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/bag-of-words-and-tf-idf/bag-of-words-and-tf-idf)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity, and every link verified.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Bag of Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irzVuSO8o4g) (**ritvikmath**). *See documents become count vectors before any weighting.*
2. **See why TF-IDF reweights** — watch [TF-IDF Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLMEnNbdh4Q) (**DataMListic**). *Why "the" gets crushed and topic words rise.*
3. **Get the math** — read [tf–idf weighting](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html) (**Stanford IR Book**). *The exact formula and the log-IDF justification.*
4. **Read the source** — [SLP3 Ch. 6 §6.5](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *TF-IDF inside the vector-semantics chapter, leading into embeddings.*
5. **Go to BM25** — watch [BM25: The Most Important Text Metric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruBm9WywevM) (**ritvikmath**), then read [Okapi BM25](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/okapi-bm25-a-non-binary-model-1.html) (**Stanford IR Book**). *The saturation + length-normalized upgrade real search engines use.*
6. **Make it concrete** — code it with [scikit-learn text feature extraction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction). *`CountVectorizer` → `TfidfVectorizer` end to end.*
