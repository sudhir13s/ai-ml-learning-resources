# Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF: turning text into vectors

Suppose I hand you ten thousand product reviews and ask you to *automatically* sort them into "happy" and "angry," or to build a search box that, given the words *"battery drains fast,"* surfaces the three reviews that complain about exactly that. A neural network won't help you until you've answered a more basic question: **what is the input?** A review is a string of characters. Logistic regression, an SVM, a nearest-neighbour search, a clustering algorithm — every one of them eats a **fixed-length vector of numbers**, not a sentence. So before any learning happens, you need a function that turns *"the battery drains fast"* into something like $[0, 1, 0, 3, 1, \dots]$ — a point in some vector space where similar documents land near each other.

**Bag-of-Words (BoW)** is the oldest and most stubbornly useful answer: *represent a document as the counts of the words it contains, over a fixed vocabulary, and throw away the order.* **TF-IDF** is the one critical refinement on top: *reweight those counts so that words appearing everywhere (like "the") count for almost nothing, while words that are frequent here but rare across the collection count a lot.* Sparse, interpretable, embarrassingly fast, and — on small-to-medium datasets — still shockingly hard to beat. It is the baseline every text system is measured against and the interview staple you must be able to derive on a whiteboard.

I'm going to build this the way I'd teach it to a teammate who's about to ship a text classifier: start from the **problem** (text → vectors), construct the **bag-of-words** representation and feel exactly what it throws away, then *derive* **term frequency** and **inverse document frequency** from scratch — including the information-theoretic reason the IDF is a logarithm — combine them into **TF-IDF**, **L2-normalize**, and use **cosine similarity** to actually retrieve and rank documents. Then we'll go past the textbook to **BM25**, the ranking function that powers Lucene/Elasticsearch and beats raw TF-IDF for search, and finish with the **limitations** that motivate dense embeddings. Along the way we build a tiny 3-document corpus **by hand**, compute every number, and then prove the hand numbers match `scikit-learn` exactly. By the end you'll be able to:

- construct a **bag-of-words** vector and a **document-term matrix**, and state precisely what information is lost;
- write the **term-frequency** variants (raw, log-normalized, augmented) and explain *why* you normalize for length;
- **derive** $\text{idf} = \log(N/df_t)$ and the smoothed variant, with the information-theoretic intuition;
- compute **TF-IDF**, L2-normalize, and rank documents by **cosine similarity** — and say why cosine beats dot product and Euclidean distance for text;
- **derive the BM25 ranking function** and explain its two knobs ($k_1$ saturation, $b$ length normalization) and why it beats TF-IDF for retrieval;
- name the limitations (no semantics, no order, OOV, huge sparse vectors) and how each motivates embeddings.

> **Note:** "bag-of-words" is a representation (a feature extractor); "TF-IDF" is a *weighting* you apply on top of that representation. You can have BoW with raw counts and no TF-IDF, and you can apply TF-IDF weighting to n-gram features that aren't single words. Keep the two ideas separate in your head — interviewers probe exactly this seam.

## The problem: documents have to become fixed-length vectors

Three of the four pillars of classic text processing — **classification**, **retrieval**, and **clustering** — all require the same thing: a function $\phi : \text{document} \to \mathbb{R}^V$ that maps any document to a fixed-dimensional vector, so that downstream math (a dot product, a distance, a linear decision boundary) is even *defined*.

The difficulty is that documents are variable-length and discrete. *"good"* and *"good good good"* and *"this product is genuinely good"* are three different strings of three different lengths. We need a single, consistent coordinate system. The bag-of-words trick is to **fix a vocabulary** $\{w_1, \dots, w_V\}$ — every distinct word the system knows — and then describe each document by **how many times each vocabulary word appears in it**. Every document, long or short, becomes a vector of length $V$. The coordinate for *"good"* is the same coordinate in every document, so the vectors are comparable.

This is exactly the **vector space model** of information retrieval (Salton, 1970s): documents and queries are points in a $V$-dimensional space, and "relevance" becomes "geometric closeness." Everything in this page is built on that one move.

> **Tip:** the feeding pipeline matters. BoW counts are only as clean as the [tokenization and normalization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/text-preprocessing-and-normalization/text-preprocessing-and-normalization) that precede them — lowercasing, stripping punctuation, optionally removing stopwords and stemming. *"Cats,"* *"cats"* and *"Cat"* collapse to one vocabulary entry only if preprocessing makes them. Garbage tokens in, garbage vectors out.

---

## Bag-of-Words: count the words, forget the order

Here is the construction, concretely. Take a tiny corpus of three documents — we'll use it for the rest of the page:

- **D1:** `the cat sat on the mat`
- **D2:** `the dog sat on the log`
- **D3:** `the happy cat chased the dog`

Step 1 — **build the vocabulary**: the sorted set of distinct tokens across all documents.

$$V = \{\text{cat}, \text{chased}, \text{dog}, \text{happy}, \text{log}, \text{mat}, \text{on}, \text{sat}, \text{the}\}, \qquad |V| = 9.$$

Step 2 — **count**: for each document, count each vocabulary word. Document D1 (`the cat sat on the mat`) has `the` twice and `cat`, `sat`, `on`, `mat` once each, and zero of everything else. Writing the counts in vocabulary order gives the **count vector**:

$$\text{BoW}(\text{D1}) = [\underbrace{1}_{\text{cat}}, \underbrace{0}_{\text{chased}}, \underbrace{0}_{\text{dog}}, \underbrace{0}_{\text{happy}}, \underbrace{0}_{\text{log}}, \underbrace{1}_{\text{mat}}, \underbrace{1}_{\text{on}}, \underbrace{1}_{\text{sat}}, \underbrace{2}_{\text{the}}].$$

Stack all three documents' vectors as rows and you get the **document-term matrix** $C$ — the central object of classic text mining. Each **row** is a document; each **column** is a vocabulary term; entry $C_{d,t}$ is the raw count of term $t$ in document $d$:

| | cat | chased | dog | happy | log | mat | on | sat | the |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| **D2** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| **D3** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |

(These counts are produced verbatim by `CountVectorizer` in the code section — they are not illustrative, they're measured.)

![The bag-of-words document-term matrix as a heatmap: each row is a document, each column a vocabulary term, each cell the raw count. The word "the" (rightmost, count 2 everywhere) dominates every row — exactly the frequent-but-uninformative problem TF-IDF will fix — and the order of words inside each document is gone, recoverable from neither the matrix nor the figure. Measured from the corpus by `count_matrix`.](images/bow_term_document_matrix.png)

That's the whole representation. The name *bag* is the key insight: a bag (multiset) remembers *what's in it and how many*, but not the order they went in. `the cat sat on the mat` and `the mat sat on the cat` produce the **identical** vector — the model literally cannot tell them apart.

### What bag-of-words throws away

It is worth being precise about the cost, because every limitation of BoW/TF-IDF traces back to one of these losses:

- **Word order / syntax.** *"dog bites man"* and *"man bites dog"* are identical vectors. Any meaning carried by order — negation scope (*"not good"* vs *"good"*), subject/object roles, sarcasm — is invisible.
- **Semantics / synonymy.** Each vocabulary word is its **own** axis, orthogonal to every other. *"car"* and *"automobile"* are as unrelated, geometrically, as *"car"* and *"banana"*: their dot product is zero. BoW has no notion that two different words can *mean* the same thing.
- **Polysemy.** Conversely, one column conflates all senses of a word: *"bank"* (river) and *"bank"* (money) pile into the same coordinate.
- **Out-of-vocabulary (OOV).** A word not seen at fit time has no column; it's silently dropped at inference.

> **Gotcha:** the orthogonality point is the single most important limitation to internalize. In BoW space, *every pair of distinct words is exactly 90° apart.* Two documents that say the same thing in different words ("the film was great" vs "the movie was excellent") can have a cosine similarity of **zero**. This is precisely the gap [word embeddings](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/word-embeddings-word2vec-glove-fasttext/word-embeddings-word2vec-glove-fasttext) close by giving related words *nearby* vectors instead of orthogonal ones.

We can recover *some* local order by adding **n-grams** as features (covered below); we recover semantics only by leaving sparse BoW entirely for dense embeddings.

## Term frequency: raw counts are a bad weight

A raw count is a crude signal for two reasons, and fixing each gives us a *variant* of term frequency (tf).

**Problem 1 — counts scale with document length.** A 1,000-word essay that mentions *"climate"* eight times is not necessarily *more* about climate than a tweet that says it twice. Raw counts conflate "how much the document is about this term" with "how long the document is." We want a length-aware notion.

**Problem 2 — relevance is sub-linear in count.** The *first* occurrence of *"climate"* tells you a lot ("this document is about climate"); the *tenth* occurrence adds very little new information. Relevance grows fast at first and then **saturates**. Raw count is linear and never saturates — it over-rewards repetition (and is gameable by keyword stuffing).

So term frequency has several standard forms, each addressing one of these:

| Variant | Formula | What it fixes |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw count** | $\text{tf}_{t,d} = f_{t,d}$ | nothing — the baseline |
| **Boolean / binary** | $\mathbb{1}[f_{t,d} > 0]$ | ignores repetition entirely |
| **Log-normalized** | $1 + \log f_{t,d}$ (for $f_{t,d}>0$, else 0) | saturation: damps high counts |
| **Length-normalized** | $f_{t,d} / \sum_{t'} f_{t',d}$ | document length |
| **Augmented (max-norm)** | $0.5 + 0.5 \cdot \dfrac{f_{t,d}}{\max_{t'} f_{t',d}}$ | length, *and* prevents bias toward long docs |

Here $f_{t,d}$ is the raw count of term $t$ in document $d$. The **log-normalized** form, $1 + \log f_{t,d}$, is the one to remember: it encodes "diminishing returns" directly — counts of 1, 10, 100 map to tf of 1, ~3.3, ~5.6. The **augmented** form rescales counts into $[0.5, 1]$ relative to the document's most frequent term, which keeps a long document from dominating purely because every count is larger.

### Worked comparison of tf variants

Numbers make the difference concrete. Suppose a term appears with raw counts of 1, 5, and 50 across three documents. Here is what each variant returns (using natural log for the log-normalized form):

| raw count $f$ | raw tf | binary | log-normalized $1+\ln f$ | how it behaves |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | $1 + 0 = 1.00$ | baseline occurrence |
| 5 | 5 | 1 | $1 + 1.609 = 2.61$ | 5× raw, only ~2.6× log |
| 50 | 50 | 1 | $1 + 3.912 = 4.91$ | 50× raw, only ~4.9× log |

The raw tf spans a **50×** range; the log-normalized tf compresses it to **~4.9×**, and the binary form flattens it to no range at all. This is the "diminishing returns" property in numbers: the jump from 1→5 (×2.6 in log space) is *larger* than the jump from 5→50 (×1.9), even though the raw count grows ten times as much. Which variant you pick depends on the task — binary for short texts where presence matters more than count (tweets, tags), log-normalized for longer documents where you want to damp repetition, raw for the scikit-learn default that leans on later L2 normalization to handle length. The instinct to internalize: **relevance is concave in count, so a concave tf transform beats a linear one** for almost every real task.

> **Source / derivation:** the log-normalized (sublinear) term-frequency transform $1 + \log f$ and the binary/augmented variants are the SMART term-weighting family catalogued in [Salton & Buckley, *Term-weighting approaches in automatic text retrieval* (1988)](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~jbollen/IR04/readings/article1-29-03.pdf) and tabulated in [Manning, Raghavan & Schütze, *Introduction to Information Retrieval*, Ch. 6 §6.4](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/sublinear-tf-scaling-1.html). Both are in the references.

Raw count (red) is linear and unbounded; the log-normalized form $1+\ln f$ (green) is concave and saturates — the green dots mark counts 1, 5, 50 mapping to tf 1.00, 2.61, 4.91, exactly the table above; binary (dashed) flattens everything to presence. The concavity is the whole point: the 10th occurrence of a word adds far less than the 1st. Generated by `make_figures_03.py` from the same `log_normalized_tf`.](images/bow_tf_variants.png)

> **Note:** in `scikit-learn`'s `TfidfVectorizer`, the default tf is the **raw count** (sublinear damping is opt-in via `sublinear_tf=True`, which switches to $1 + \log f$), and document-length normalization is handled afterwards by **L2-normalizing the final tf-idf vector** rather than dividing tf by document length. Different libraries make different default choices here — always check which tf and which normalization a tool uses before comparing numbers.

## Inverse document frequency: derive it from first principles

Term frequency tells you how important a term is *within a document*. But it says nothing about whether the term is **discriminating** *across the collection*. The word `the` appears in essentially every English document — it has high tf everywhere and yet tells you nothing about what any particular document is about. We need a factor that **down-weights terms that are common across documents** and **up-weights terms that are rare**. That factor is **inverse document frequency (idf)**, and we can derive its exact form.

Define the **document frequency** of a term $t$:

$$df_t = \text{number of documents (out of } N\text{) that contain } t \text{ at least once.}$$

Note: document frequency, **not** total count — it's "in how many documents," capped at 1 per document. A term in **every** document ($df_t = N$) is useless for discrimination; a term in **one** document ($df_t = 1$) is maximally specific.

### The information-theoretic derivation

The cleanest justification comes from information theory (this is essentially Spärck Jones's 1972 argument). Treat "a randomly drawn document contains term $t$" as an event with probability

$$p_t = \frac{df_t}{N}.$$

The **self-information** (surprisal) of observing that event is $-\log p_t = \log \frac{N}{df_t}$. A term that appears in every document ($p_t = 1$) carries surprisal $\log 1 = 0$ — observing it tells you nothing, you expected it. A rare term ($p_t$ small) carries large surprisal — observing it is informative, it *narrows down* which document you're looking at. Inverse document frequency is exactly this surprisal:

$$\boxed{\;\text{idf}_t = \log \frac{N}{df_t}\;}$$

> **Source / derivation:** inverse document frequency originates with [Spärck Jones, *A Statistical Interpretation of Term Specificity and its Application in Retrieval* (1972)](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/idfpapers/ksj_orig.pdf), which argues term specificity should weight retrieval; the information-theoretic reading of $\log(N/df_t)$ as the surprisal $-\log p_t$ is laid out in [Manning, Raghavan & Schütze, *Introduction to Information Retrieval*, Ch. 6 §6.2.1](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/inverse-document-frequency-1.html). Both are in the references.

That is the canonical definition. The **logarithm is not arbitrary** — it is the information content of the event "this term appears," which is why a term appearing in 1 doc out of 1,000 isn't 1,000× more useful than one in every doc; it's $\log 1000 \approx 6.9$× (in nats) more useful. The log compresses the enormous range of document frequencies into a sane, additive scale, exactly as information content should.

![IDF as a function of document frequency for a collection of N=1000 documents. The textbook idf = log(N/df) (blue) drops to 0 for a term appearing in every document (carries no information) and rises sharply for rare terms. The smoothed sklearn variant log((1+N)/(1+df)) + 1 (purple, dashed) keeps the same shape but stays strictly positive. Generated by `make_figures_03.py`.](images/bow_idf_curve.png)

### Smoothing: avoid division by zero and zero weights

Two edge cases break the raw formula. If a query term never appears in the collection, $df_t = 0$ and we divide by zero. And a term in *every* document gets $\text{idf}_t = 0$, which **zeroes out** its tf-idf entirely — sometimes too aggressive. The standard fix is **smoothed idf**, used by `scikit-learn`:

$$\text{idf}_t^{\text{smooth}} = \log \frac{1 + N}{1 + df_t} + 1.$$

The $1+$ in numerator and denominator acts as if there were one extra document containing every term (so no division by zero), and the trailing $+1$ guarantees idf is **strictly positive** for every term — even a term in all documents keeps a small nonzero weight rather than being annihilated. The shape is unchanged: rare terms still get the largest weight.

> **Gotcha:** the most common interview slip is confusing **document frequency** ($df_t$, how many *documents* contain the term, max $N$) with **collection/term frequency** (the total *count* across the whole corpus). IDF uses **document** frequency. A word that appears 50 times but all in one document has $df_t = 1$ — it's *rare* across documents and gets a high idf, which is correct: it's a strong signal for *that one* document.

---

## TF-IDF: multiply them together

The TF-IDF weight of term $t$ in document $d$ is simply the product:

$$\boxed{\;\text{tfidf}_{t,d} = \text{tf}_{t,d} \times \text{idf}_t\;}$$

> **Source / derivation:** the TF×IDF combination and the vector space model it feeds were systematized in [Salton & Buckley, *Term-weighting approaches in automatic text retrieval* (1988)](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~jbollen/IR04/readings/article1-29-03.pdf); the canonical free derivation is [Manning, Raghavan & Schütze, *Introduction to Information Retrieval*, Ch. 6 §6.2.2 "Tf-idf weighting"](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html). The smoothed variant below is exactly what [scikit-learn's `TfidfTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#tfidf-term-weighting) implements. All in the references.

Read the four corners of this product and you understand the whole scheme:

- **High tf, high idf** → **large weight.** The term is frequent *in this document* and rare *across the collection* — exactly a topic/keyword for this document (e.g. `happy` in D3). These are the words TF-IDF promotes.
- **High tf, low idf** → **small weight.** Frequent here but everywhere else too (e.g. `the`) — a stopword; tf-idf crushes it even though its raw count is the highest in every document.
- **Low tf, high idf** → **small-to-moderate weight.** Rare term mentioned once; a weak signal.
- **Low tf, low idf** → **tiny weight.** Uninformative on both axes.

The magic is in the *first two rows*: TF-IDF automatically **discovers stopwords from data**. You never have to hand-curate a stopword list — any term that appears in (nearly) every document has $\text{idf} \approx 0$ and gets weighted to near-zero on its own. That is the whole point of the IDF factor.

### Worked example: compute the matrix by hand

Let's compute tf-idf for our 3-document corpus, using **raw-count tf** and **smoothed idf** (matching `scikit-learn`, $N=3$). First the idf for each term, from its document frequency:

| term | $df_t$ | $\text{idf}^{\text{smooth}} = \log\frac{1+N}{1+df_t}+1$ | value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `the` | 3 | $\log\frac{4}{4}+1 = 0+1$ | **1.0000** |
| `cat` | 2 | $\log\frac{4}{3}+1 = 0.2877+1$ | **1.2877** |
| `dog` | 2 | $\log\frac{4}{3}+1$ | **1.2877** |
| `sat` | 2 | $\log\frac{4}{3}+1$ | **1.2877** |
| `on` | 2 | $\log\frac{4}{3}+1$ | **1.2877** |
| `happy` | 1 | $\log\frac{4}{2}+1 = 0.6931+1$ | **1.6931** |
| `mat` | 1 | $\log\frac{4}{2}+1$ | **1.6931** |
| `log` | 1 | $\log\frac{4}{2}+1$ | **1.6931** |
| `chased` | 1 | $\log\frac{4}{2}+1$ | **1.6931** |

Look at `the`: it appears in all 3 documents, so its smoothed idf is exactly **1.0** — and with plain (unsmoothed) idf it would be $\log(3/3) = 0$, killing it entirely. Either way, the most frequent word in every document gets the **lowest** weight. That is IDF doing its job.

Now multiply each raw count by its term's idf. For **D1** (`the`×2, `cat`, `sat`, `on`, `mat` ×1):

$$\text{tfidf}(\text{D1}) : \quad \underbrace{\text{cat}=1\times1.2877=1.2877}_{}, \;\; \underbrace{\text{mat}=1\times1.6931=1.6931}_{}, \;\; \underbrace{\text{on}=1.2877}_{}, \;\; \underbrace{\text{sat}=1.2877}_{}, \;\; \underbrace{\text{the}=2\times1.0=2.0}_{}.$$

So in D1 the highest-weighted term is `mat` (1.69) — it appears once but is unique to D1 — while `the`, despite the highest raw count (2), only scores 2.0 *before* normalization and, crucially, becomes the *least* informative axis after we normalize. This is the un-normalized tf-idf row; `scikit-learn` returns exactly these numbers (`norm=None`), which we verify in code.

![Raw count versus un-normalized TF-IDF weight for the terms of D1, sorted by TF-IDF. Raw counts (slate) rank "the" (×2) on top; TF-IDF (green) holds "the" flat — its smoothed idf is exactly 1.0 because it appears in every document — while lifting the *distinctive* "mat" (unique to D1, df=1) above the shared "cat"/"on"/"sat" (df=2). This is the discriminative signal a classifier or search index actually wants. Measured by `make_figures_03.py`.](images/bow_tfidf_vs_counts.png)

> **Tip:** notice `mat` (1.69) outscores `cat` (1.29) in D1 even though both appear once. Why? `mat` is unique to D1 ($df=1$) while `cat` is shared with D3 ($df=2$). TF-IDF rewards the term that better *distinguishes* this document from the rest. That's the discriminative signal a downstream classifier or search index actually wants.

---

## L2-normalize: make documents comparable regardless of length

The raw tf-idf vectors still have a length bias: a longer document has more nonzero entries and a larger overall magnitude, which would let document *length* dominate similarity. The standard cure is to **L2-normalize** each document vector to unit length:

$$\hat{v}_d = \frac{v_d}{\lVert v_d \rVert_2}, \qquad \lVert v_d \rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_t v_{d,t}^2}.$$

After this, every document is a **point on the unit hypersphere**. Let's normalize D1. Its un-normalized entries are $\{1.2877, 1.6931, 1.2877, 1.2877, 2.0\}$ (cat, mat, on, sat, the). The L2 norm is

$$\lVert v_{\text{D1}} \rVert_2 = \sqrt{1.2877^2 + 1.6931^2 + 1.2877^2 + 1.2877^2 + 2.0^2} = \sqrt{11.84} \approx 3.441.$$

Dividing through gives the normalized weights: `the` $= 2.0/3.441 = 0.5812$, `mat` $= 1.6931/3.441 = 0.4920$, `cat`=`on`=`sat` $= 1.2877/3.441 = 0.3742$. These exact numbers are what the heatmap below shows and what `scikit-learn` returns by default (it L2-normalizes rows):

![TF-IDF document-term matrix for the 3-document corpus after L2 normalization. Each row is a unit vector. The word "the" appears in every document and still carries the largest single weight per row (~0.58, from its count of 2 at idf 1.0), with the distinctive terms "mat", "log", "happy", "chased" ranking just below as the discriminating signal. Measured by `tfidf_matrix`, identical to scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer`.](images/bow_tfidf_matrix_heatmap.png)

> **Note:** after L2 normalization, the **dot product of two document vectors equals their cosine similarity** (because both are unit vectors, the denominator of cosine is 1). This is not a coincidence — it's why retrieval systems store L2-normalized vectors: ranking by dot product is then identical to ranking by cosine, and dot products are what fast linear-algebra kernels compute. Normalize once, rank by dot product forever.

---

## Cosine similarity: why angle, not distance

We now have each document as a unit vector. To retrieve and rank, we need a **similarity** between a query vector $q$ and each document vector $d$. The standard choice is **cosine similarity** — the cosine of the angle between them:

$$\cos(q, d) = \frac{q \cdot d}{\lVert q \rVert_2 \, \lVert d \rVert_2} = \frac{\sum_t q_t d_t}{\sqrt{\sum_t q_t^2}\,\sqrt{\sum_t d_t^2}}.$$

> **Source / derivation:** cosine similarity as the relevance measure in the vector space model is from [Salton, Wong & Yang, *A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing* (1975)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361219.361220) (and the [free Manning IR-book Ch. 6 §6.3 "The vector space model for scoring"](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/the-vector-space-model-for-scoring-1.html)), where documents and queries are points in term space and relevance is the cosine of the angle between them. In the references.

It ranges from 0 (orthogonal — no shared terms) to 1 (same direction — proportional term profiles). Why cosine and not the two obvious alternatives?

**Why not raw dot product?** The bare dot product $q \cdot d$ rewards **magnitude**: a long document with many terms can score high against any query simply because it has more nonzero entries, regardless of whether it's *about* the query. Cosine divides out both magnitudes, measuring only the **direction** of the term profile — *what fraction of the document's "energy" points along the query.* (After L2 normalization, of course, dot product and cosine coincide — that's the point of normalizing.)

**Why not Euclidean distance?** Consider a document and a copy of itself repeated three times: same words, three times the counts. Their term *profiles* are identical (they're about the same thing), but their Euclidean distance is large because one vector is 3× longer. Cosine sees them as **identical** (angle 0, cosine 1) — which is what we want: repetition shouldn't change topical similarity. In high-dimensional sparse spaces, Euclidean distance is dominated by length differences and is a poor relevance signal; **angle is length-invariant**, which is exactly the invariance text retrieval needs.

To make the geometry tangible: cosine of 0 means the two term-profile vectors point in the **same direction** (a 0° angle), cosine of $1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.707$ means they're **45°** apart, and cosine of 0 means they're **90°** apart (orthogonal, no shared terms). Our measured $\cos(\text{D1},\text{D2}) = 0.618$ corresponds to an angle of $\arccos(0.618) \approx 52°$ — the two documents point in *broadly* similar directions but are clearly distinct, which matches intuition: they share the sentence frame but differ on the content nouns. There is a neat algebraic bonus: for L2-normalized vectors, squared Euclidean distance and cosine are tied by $\lVert \hat{q} - \hat{d}\rVert_2^2 = 2 - 2\cos(q,d)$. So *after* L2 normalization, ranking by (ascending) Euclidean distance and ranking by (descending) cosine give the **identical order** — the normalization is what reconciles the two. The reason we still speak in cosine is that it's bounded in $[0,1]$ for non-negative tf-idf and reads directly as "fraction of shared direction."

### Worked example: cosine between two documents

Take the L2-normalized D1 and D2 from the heatmap. They share the terms `on`, `sat`, `the` (each contributes the product of their normalized weights) and differ on `cat`/`mat` (D1) vs `dog`/`log` (D2). The three shared terms have identical normalized weights in both documents ($0.3742, 0.3742, 0.5812$), so:

$$\cos(\text{D1}, \text{D2}) = 0.3742^2 + 0.3742^2 + 0.5812^2 = 0.1400 + 0.1400 + 0.3378 = 0.618.$$

(Only the shared dimensions contribute; the unique terms multiply against zero.) And $\cos(\text{D1}, \text{D3})$: they share only `cat` and `the`, giving $0.3742 \times 0.3565 + 0.5812 \times 0.5536 = 0.1334 + 0.3218 \approx 0.455$. So D1 is **more similar to D2 than to D3** — sensible, since D1 and D2 share the *whole sentence frame* `the … sat on the …` while D1 and D3 share only `cat` and `the`. The full measured matrix:

| cosine | D1 | D2 | D3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | 1.000 | 0.618 | 0.455 |
| **D2** | 0.618 | 1.000 | 0.455 |
| **D3** | 0.455 | 0.455 | 1.000 |

![Pairwise cosine similarity between the three documents as a heatmap. The diagonal is 1 (each document is identical to itself); D1–D2 (0.618) is the brightest off-diagonal because they share the entire sentence frame "the … sat on the …", while D1–D3 and D2–D3 (0.455) share less. Symmetric by construction. Measured by `cosine_similarity_matrix`.](images/bow_cosine_heatmap.png)

These exact values come out of `cosine_similarity` in the code section. Notice how much of the 0.618 between D1 and D2 is carried by `the` ($0.3378$ of $0.618$, more than half) — a hint that stopword-heavy similarity is shaky, and a reason real systems often *remove* stopwords before vectorizing.

> **Tip:** for a **query**, you transform it with the *same* fitted vectorizer (same vocabulary, same idf weights learned from the corpus), then cosine it against every document. Search becomes: vectorize query → dot product with the (normalized) document-term matrix → sort descending. With a sparse matrix this is a single fast sparse mat-vec, which is why TF-IDF retrieval scales to millions of documents on a laptop.

## N-gram features: smuggling order back in

Pure unigram BoW loses all order. A cheap partial fix is to add **n-grams** — contiguous sequences of $n$ tokens — as *additional vocabulary entries*. With bigrams, `not good` becomes its own feature distinct from `not` and `good`, so the classifier can learn that `not good` is negative even though `good` alone is positive. The bigram vocabulary of D1 (`the cat sat on the mat`) is `the cat`, `cat sat`, `sat on`, `on the`, `the mat`.

This is the link to [n-gram language models](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/n-gram-language-models-and-smoothing/n-gram-language-models-and-smoothing): the same contiguous-window idea, used there for *prediction* and here for *features*. In practice `TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2))` mixes unigrams and bigrams, and bigrams reliably lift text-classification accuracy a few points — capturing negation, fixed phrases (`new york`, `machine learning`), and short idioms.

There is also a **character** n-gram variant (`analyzer="char_wb"`): instead of word sequences, the features are sliding windows of characters (e.g. `_ca`, `cat`, `at_`). Character n-grams are surprisingly robust — they handle misspellings, morphology, and even languages without clean word boundaries, because a typo like `recieve` still shares most of its character trigrams with `receive`. They're a common choice for noisy text (social media, OCR output) and for language identification, where word-level features fail. The cost, as always, is a larger feature space.

> **Gotcha:** n-grams explode the vocabulary. Unigrams might give 50k features; add bigrams and you can hit *millions*, most appearing once or twice (noise). You then **prune** with `min_df` (drop terms in too few documents) and `max_df` (drop terms in too many — a data-driven stopword filter) and often a hashing trick or feature cap. N-grams trade dimensionality for a little order — useful, but with a steep cost you have to manage.

---

## The curse of dimensionality and sparsity

A real vocabulary is **enormous** — tens of thousands to millions of terms — so each document vector lives in a space of that dimension, yet a single document touches only a few hundred of those coordinates. The vectors are therefore **extremely sparse** (99.9%+ zeros). This has two faces:

![BoW matrix sparsity (percentage of zero entries) as the vocabulary grows from 100 to 1,000,000 terms, for a document touching ~120 distinct words. Density falls as ~1/V, so a ~120-term document sits at 99.99% zeros in a million-term vocabulary — illustrative of real corpora, not the 9-word toy corpus. This is why TF-IDF matrices are stored as sparse structures and dot products skip the zeros. Generated by `make_figures_03.py`.](images/bow_sparsity.png)


- **The good:** sparsity is what makes TF-IDF *fast*. You store only nonzero entries (a `scipy.sparse` CSR matrix), and dot products skip the zeros. A million-document × million-term matrix that would be $10^{12}$ dense floats fits comfortably as a few hundred MB sparse.
- **The bad:** in very high dimensions, distances **concentrate** — every pair of random sparse vectors looks almost equally far apart, so naive nearest-neighbour search degrades. And because dimensions are independent word-axes, the representation has **no generalization across words**: learning that `excellent` is positive teaches the model *nothing* about `superb`. Every word must be learned from its own evidence.

> **Note:** the "huge sparse vector" is both BoW/TF-IDF's superpower (fast, exact, interpretable — you can read off *which words* drove a prediction) and its ceiling (no generalization across related words, no sense of meaning). Dense embeddings invert the trade: a few hundred *dense* dimensions where related words are *close*, gaining generalization at the cost of interpretability. Which side of that trade you want depends on data size and the need to explain decisions.

## BM25: the ranking function search engines actually use

TF-IDF + cosine is a fine baseline, but production search (Lucene, Elasticsearch, Solr) ranks with **BM25** ("Best Match 25," Robertson & Zaragoza), which fixes two weaknesses of plain TF-IDF: linear (unbounded) term frequency, and crude length handling. It's the most important upgrade to know, and it's *derivable* as a few sensible patches to TF-IDF.

For a query $Q$ (a set of terms) and document $D$, the BM25 score is a **sum over query terms**:

$$\boxed{\;\text{BM25}(Q, D) = \sum_{t \in Q} \text{idf}(t) \cdot \frac{f_{t,D}\,(k_1 + 1)}{f_{t,D} + k_1\left(1 - b + b\,\dfrac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)}\;}$$

> **Source / derivation:** BM25 ("Best Match 25") comes from the Okapi experiments of [Robertson et al., *Okapi at TREC-3* (1994)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/okapi_trec3.pdf) and is derived in full from the probabilistic relevance framework in [Robertson & Zaragoza, *The Probabilistic Relevance Framework: BM25 and Beyond* (2009)](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf); the free [Manning IR-book Ch. 11 §11.4.3 "Okapi BM25"](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/okapi-bm25-a-non-binary-model-1.html) gives a compact treatment. All in the references.

where $f_{t,D}$ is the raw count of $t$ in $D$, $|D|$ is the document length (in tokens), $\text{avgdl}$ is the average document length in the collection, and $k_1, b$ are tuning knobs. The idf is the Robertson–Spärck-Jones variant: $\text{idf}(t) = \ln\!\left(1 + \frac{N - df_t + 0.5}{df_t + 0.5}\right)$ (smoothed, and always positive). Let's read the formula in three pieces.

### Piece 1 — the IDF component

Same idea as before: rare query terms count more, but BM25's idf has a probabilistic pedigree worth one line. The **probabilistic relevance framework** asks: for a term $t$, what are the odds it appears in a *relevant* document versus a *non-relevant* one? With no relevance feedback, you estimate that "a document not containing $t$" is the non-relevant proxy, and the odds-ratio collapses to

$$\text{idf}_{\text{BM25}}(t) = \ln \frac{N - df_t + 0.5}{df_t + 0.5},$$

with the modern variant wrapping it as $\ln\!\big(1 + \frac{N - df_t + 0.5}{df_t + 0.5}\big)$ to keep it non-negative even when $df_t > N/2$. The $+0.5$ terms are Bayesian smoothing (a uniform prior). So BM25's idf is not an ad-hoc log like the textbook tf-idf — it falls out of asking "how much does this term shift the odds of relevance?" The practical effect is the same as before: a term in nearly every document contributes almost nothing; a rare term contributes a lot. It's the discriminative-power factor, now derived rather than asserted.

### Piece 2 — term-frequency saturation via $k_1$

Look at the tf part with length-normalization off ($b=0$): $\frac{f(k_1+1)}{f + k_1}$. As $f \to \infty$ this approaches $k_1 + 1$ — a **horizontal asymptote**. Unlike raw tf (which grows forever), BM25's tf component **saturates**: the first occurrence of a query term gives a big jump, the second a smaller one, and beyond a point extra occurrences barely move the score. $k_1$ (typically **1.2–2.0**) controls *how fast* it saturates — small $k_1$ saturates almost immediately (close to binary "present or not"), large $k_1$ stays near-linear longer.

![BM25 term-frequency saturation versus raw TF-IDF. Raw tf (dashed red) grows linearly and unbounded, so a keyword-stuffed document scores arbitrarily high. BM25's tf component (solid curves, for k1 = 1.2 / 1.5 / 2.0) saturates toward a ceiling of k1+1; the parameter k1 controls how quickly. This is why BM25 resists keyword stuffing. Measured by `bm25_tf_component` in `make_figures_03.py`.](images/bow_bm25_saturation.png)

Why this matters: raw TF-IDF lets a document that repeats a query word 50 times score ~50× a document that uses it once — easily gamed by **keyword stuffing**. BM25 says the 50th occurrence is barely worth more than the 5th. Concretely, with $k_1 = 1.5$ and $b = 0$, the tf component for counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50 is **1.00, 1.43, 1.67, 1.92, 2.17, 2.43** — climbing toward the ceiling $k_1 + 1 = 2.5$ but never reaching it. The 50× raw spread collapses to a 2.4× scored spread. That saturation is BM25's headline advantage over TF-IDF for ranking.

### Piece 3 — document-length normalization via $b$

The denominator term $k_1\!\left(1 - b + b\,\frac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)$ normalizes for length. The knob $b \in [0,1]$ interpolates:

- $b = 0$ → no length normalization (the bracket is just $k_1$); long and short documents treated equally.
- $b = 1$ → **full** normalization by relative length $|D|/\text{avgdl}$.
- $b \approx 0.75$ (the standard default) → partial. The intuition: a longer document naturally contains more words, so a query-term match in a long document is **less surprising** and should count for less than the same match in a short, focused document. Dividing by relative length penalizes long documents — but only partially, because some documents are legitimately long *and* on-topic, and we don't want to punish them fully.

### Worked example: BM25 vs TF-IDF ranking

Take a 5-document corpus and the query **`happy cat`**. Ranking by BM25 (Okapi, $k_1{=}1.5$, $b{=}0.75$) gives the measured scores: **D3** (`the happy cat chased the dog`) = **2.39**, **D1** (`the cat sat on the mat`) = **0.92**, and D2/D4/D5 = 0 (they contain neither `happy` nor `cat`). The cosine-TF-IDF ranking agrees on order — D3 (0.61) above D1 (0.25) — but BM25 *widens* the gap, because D3 matches **both** query terms (`happy` is rare, so its idf is high) while D1 matches only `cat`:

![Retrieval ranking for query "happy cat" over a 5-document corpus, comparing cosine TF-IDF (blue, scores 0.247 for D1 and 0.615 for D3) and BM25 (green, normalized to its max for the chart). Both rank D3 (contains both "happy" and "cat") above D1 (only "cat"), and score the three non-matching documents at zero. BM25 widens the margin because "happy" is a rare, high-idf term. Measured by `tfidf_query_scores` and `bm25_scores` — the IDF is fit on the corpus and the query projected in, the correct no-leak discipline.](images/bow_retrieval_ranking.png)

The two methods **agree on the ranking** here but BM25 gives a sharper, better-calibrated separation — which, scaled to a real collection with documents of wildly varying length, is the difference between a mediocre and a good search experience.

> **Tip:** if you're building search and reaching for TF-IDF cosine, reach for **BM25 instead** — it's a near-drop-in upgrade (same inputs: term counts, document frequencies, lengths) that's the default in every serious lexical search engine. TF-IDF cosine is the better choice when you're building *features for a classifier*; BM25 is the better choice when you're *ranking documents for a query*. See [Information Retrieval & Semantic Search](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search) for where BM25 meets dense retrieval.

## Where it's used: classification, retrieval, clustering, keywords

TF-IDF vectors feed an enormous amount of practical NLP. Four canonical uses:

**1. Text classification.** TF-IDF features + a **linear model** is the classic strong baseline. **Multinomial Naive Bayes** treats each document as a bag of (weighted) word events and is famously good on text despite its naive independence assumption; a **linear SVM** or **logistic regression** on L2-normalized TF-IDF is the workhorse for sentiment, spam, and topic labeling — fast to train, easy to interpret (read the largest-weight features per class), and competitive with neural models when data is limited. See [Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/text-classification-and-sentiment-analysis/text-classification-and-sentiment-analysis).

**2. Information retrieval / search.** The vector space model (TF-IDF cosine) and its successor BM25 are the foundation of lexical search; they're still half of modern **hybrid retrieval** (BM25 + dense embeddings), where the lexical side catches exact keyword and rare-term matches that embeddings miss. See [Information Retrieval & Semantic Search](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search).

**3. Clustering and topic discovery.** TF-IDF vectors fed to k-means or hierarchical clustering group documents by shared distinctive vocabulary. And the TF-IDF document-term matrix is the *input* to classic [topic models](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/topic-modeling-lda-nmf/topic-modeling-lda-nmf) — **NMF** factorizes it directly, and **LDA** typically runs on raw counts but uses the same BoW representation.

**4. Keyword extraction.** The simplest keyphrase extractor: TF-IDF-weight a document's terms and take the top-$k$ — those are, by construction, the words that are frequent *here* but rare *elsewhere*, i.e. what the document is distinctively about. It's the one-line "what is this document about?" baseline.

> **Note:** TF-IDF's interpretability is a genuine production advantage. When a TF-IDF + logistic-regression spam classifier flags an email, you can print the exact words (`viagra`, `wire transfer`, `prince`) that drove the decision — their tf-idf weight × the model coefficient. Try explaining a transformer's decision that cleanly. For regulated or auditable settings, this transparency alone keeps TF-IDF in production.

---

## Application: a TF-IDF classifier / search pipeline, step by step

Here's the playbook I'd actually run to ship a TF-IDF system end to end:

1. **Preprocess** — lowercase, tokenize, strip punctuation. Decide on stopword removal (usually yes for retrieval, sometimes no for classification where function words carry signal) and stemming/lemmatization (collapses `running`/`ran`/`runs`). See [Text Preprocessing](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/text-preprocessing-and-normalization/text-preprocessing-and-normalization).
2. **Fit the vocabulary on the training set only.** Choose `ngram_range` (unigrams, or `(1,2)` for bigrams), and prune with `min_df` (drop ultra-rare terms — typos, noise) and `max_df` (drop ultra-common terms — data-driven stopwords). This bounds dimensionality.
3. **Learn idf from the training corpus**, build the document-term matrix, apply tf-idf weighting, **L2-normalize**.
4. **For classification:** train a linear SVM / logistic regression / Multinomial NB on the matrix; inspect top features per class as a sanity check.
5. **For retrieval:** store the normalized matrix; at query time, transform the query with the *same* vectorizer and rank documents by cosine (= dot product). Or skip straight to **BM25** for ranking.
6. **Evaluate and iterate** — accuracy/F1 for classification, or precision@k / nDCG for retrieval; tune `ngram_range`, `min_df`/`max_df`, `sublinear_tf`, and (for BM25) $k_1$, $b$.

> **Gotcha:** **fit the vectorizer on training data only**, then `transform` (never `fit_transform`) the test/validation/query data. Fitting on the test set leaks idf statistics — the test set's document frequencies — into your features, inflating offline metrics in a way that won't hold in production. This is the single most common TF-IDF bug in interviews and in real notebooks.

## Code: build it by hand, then match scikit-learn exactly

This runs on CPU in under a second. It builds the BoW count matrix, computes tf-idf by hand, and verifies the hand numbers match `scikit-learn`'s `TfidfVectorizer` — then does a small retrieval ranking with both cosine-TF-IDF and BM25.

> **Runnable script and a step-by-step notebook:** the verified code lives as a clean source-of-truth script and an executed teaching notebook next to this page — see the [step-by-step teaching notebook](code/bag-of-words-and-tf-idf.ipynb) and the [runnable demo script](code/bow_tfidf.py) (run it with `python bow_tfidf.py`). Every number on this page and every figure is produced by importing from that one script, so they cannot drift. The notebook proves each qualitative claim with an `assert` before it prints the number.

The cosine and BM25 numbers match the worked examples and the diagrams above exactly — every number on this page is measured, not asserted.

> **Tip:** to see why **stopwords hurt**, re-run with `TfidfVectorizer(stop_words="english")`. The cosine between D1 and D2 drops sharply because `the`, `on` — which carried ~60% of their old similarity — disappear, leaving only the genuinely content-bearing overlap. For *retrieval*, removing stopwords usually helps; for *classification*, test it, since function words can carry stylistic signal.

## Limitations → why embeddings exist

Pulling the threads together, here is the honest ledger of what BoW/TF-IDF cannot do — and each gap names a successor:

- **No semantics (synonymy).** Distinct words are orthogonal axes; `car` and `automobile` have similarity 0. → [Word embeddings](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/word-embeddings-word2vec-glove-fasttext/word-embeddings-word2vec-glove-fasttext) place related words *near* each other so similar meaning ⇒ similar vector.
- **No word order / syntax.** `dog bites man` = `man bites dog`. N-grams patch this locally at a steep dimensionality cost; **sequence models** (RNNs, transformers) model order natively.
- **No polysemy resolution.** One vector per word type, all senses merged. → [Contextual embeddings](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/contextual-embeddings-elmo-bert/contextual-embeddings-elmo-bert) (ELMo, BERT) give a *different* vector per occurrence based on context.
- **Out-of-vocabulary words.** Unseen terms have no column and vanish. → Subword [tokenization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/tokenization-and-subword-algorithms/tokenization-and-subword-algorithms) (BPE, WordPiece) and FastText's character n-grams handle novel words.
- **Huge, sparse dimensionality.** $V$ in the tens of thousands to millions. → Dense embeddings compress to a few hundred dimensions with generalization across words.

> **Note:** none of this makes TF-IDF obsolete. On small datasets, for interpretable features, for exact keyword matching, and as the lexical half of hybrid search, it remains a first-class tool in 2026. The lesson is *complementarity*: lexical (TF-IDF/BM25) catches exact and rare terms; dense embeddings catch meaning and paraphrase. The strongest retrieval systems run **both**. Reach for embeddings when you need semantics and have the data; reach for TF-IDF when you need speed, interpretability, or exact matching.

## Provenance: the people who built this

The ideas have a clean lineage worth knowing for interviews:

- **Luhn (1957)** proposed using word *frequency* to measure significance — the seed of term frequency.
- **Spärck Jones (1972)**, *"A Statistical Interpretation of Term Specificity,"* introduced **inverse document frequency** and the information-theoretic argument that term specificity should weight retrieval — the single most-cited idea on this page.
- **Salton & Buckley (1988)**, *"Term-weighting approaches in automatic text retrieval,"* systematized the **TF-IDF** family and the vector space model with cosine.
- **Robertson & Zaragoza (2009)**, *"The Probabilistic Relevance Framework: BM25 and Beyond,"* gives the modern derivation of **BM25** from probabilistic retrieval theory.
- **Manning, Raghavan & Schütze**, *Introduction to Information Retrieval* (Ch. 6), is the canonical free textbook treatment tying tf, idf, the vector space model, and cosine together.

## Recap and rapid-fire

**If you remember nothing else:** represent a document as a vector of word counts over a fixed vocabulary (**bag-of-words**, which discards order and meaning); reweight each count by **tf** (importance within the document) times **idf** $= \log(N/df_t)$ (a term's rarity, hence discriminating power, across the collection); **L2-normalize**; and rank by **cosine similarity** (angle, so length-invariant). It's sparse, fast, interpretable, and a strong baseline — but it has no semantics (synonyms are orthogonal) and no order, which is exactly what embeddings fix. For *search*, prefer **BM25**, which saturates term frequency ($k_1$) and normalizes for length ($b$).

**Quick-fire — say these out loud:**

- *Write the TF-IDF formula.* $\text{tfidf}_{t,d} = \text{tf}_{t,d} \cdot \log(N/df_t)$ (smoothed: $\log\frac{1+N}{1+df_t}+1$).
- *Why is IDF a logarithm?* It's the self-information $-\log p_t$ of "the term appears"; a term in every doc carries 0 bits, a rare term carries many.
- *df vs collection frequency?* IDF uses **document** frequency (how many *documents* contain the term, max $N$), not the total count.
- *Why does TF-IDF crush "the"?* `the` is in (nearly) every document, so $df \approx N$ and $\text{idf} \approx 0$ — it auto-discovers stopwords from data.
- *Why cosine, not Euclidean or dot product?* Cosine is **length-invariant** (measures the angle / term profile); Euclidean and raw dot product are dominated by document length.
- *What does L2-normalization buy you?* Unit vectors, so dot product = cosine, and document length stops biasing similarity.
- *What does BoW lose?* Word order, syntax, semantics (synonyms orthogonal), polysemy; OOV words drop out.
- *BM25 over TF-IDF — what's different?* TF saturation via $k_1$ (resists keyword stuffing) and document-length normalization via $b$.
- *Biggest TF-IDF bug?* Fitting the vectorizer on the test set — leaks idf statistics.
- *Why do embeddings exist?* To give synonyms *nearby* vectors instead of orthogonal axes, and to generalize across related words.
