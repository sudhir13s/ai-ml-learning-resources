# Word Embeddings — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Word Embeddings](word-embeddings-word2vec-glove-fasttext.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first within each group. Every entry is free/open and from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity, and every link verified.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Word2Vec, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viZrOnJclY0) (**StatQuest**), then read [The Illustrated Word2Vec](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/) (**Jay Alammar**). *Fastest route to a correct mental model.*
2. **Feel the geometry** — explore the [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) and watch [Vectoring Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQddtTdmG_8) (**Computerphile**). *Makes king − man + woman ≈ queen tangible.*
3. **Get the math** — [CS224N Lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERibwqs9p38) + [SLP3 Ch. 6](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf). *The objective, gradients, and negative sampling you'll be asked to derive.*
4. **Read the sources** — [word2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) → [negative sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546) → [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) → [FastText](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606) → [Levy & Goldberg](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5477-neural-word-embedding-as-implicit-matrix-factorization). *Predictive → global co-occurrence → subword → the unification.*
5. **Make it concrete** — implement skip-gram + negative sampling with [d2l Ch. 15](https://d2l.ai/chapter_natural-language-processing-pretraining/index.html).
