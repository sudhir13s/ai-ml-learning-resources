# Decoding Strategies — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Decoding Strategies](decoding-strategies.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — read [How to generate text: different decoding methods](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate) (**Patrick von Platen, Hugging Face**). *The definitive, code-backed tour of greedy, beam, top-k, and top-p — run it as you read.*
2. **See the sampling knobs move** — watch [Random Sampling (Temperature, top-p, top-k) for LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mti5XUm22Og) (**Minsuk Heo**). *Each parameter visibly reshaping the distribution.*
3. **Read the source result** — [The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751) (**Holtzman et al., 2020**). *Why greedy/beam degenerate and nucleus sampling fixes it — the paper that introduced top-p.*
4. **Get the textbook reference** — [SLP3 — Large Language Models (sampling & decoding)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/10.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *Greedy, beam, temperature, top-k, top-p in the standard text.*
5. **Make it concrete** — code it with [HF Text generation strategies](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/generation_strategies) (**Hugging Face**). *Flip `num_beams`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `temperature`, `repetition_penalty` and compare outputs.*
