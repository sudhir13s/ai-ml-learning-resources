# Question Answering — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Question Answering](question-answering.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame the task** — read [SLP3 Ch. 11: Information Retrieval and RAG](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/11.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *Extractive vs open-domain QA before any model.*
2. **See extractive QA** — watch [Applying BERT to Question Answering (SQuAD v1.1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ZYCvgGu0o) (**Chris McCormick**), then read ⭐ [Question Answering with a Fine-Tuned BERT](https://mccormickml.com/2020/03/10/question-answering-with-a-fine-tuned-BERT/). *Exactly how start/end span prediction works.*
3. **Get open-domain QA** — read [How to Build an Open-Domain QA System](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2020-10-29-odqa/) (**Lilian Weng**). *The retriever–reader pipeline, rigorously.*
4. **Read the sources** — [SQuAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250) → [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) → [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) → [RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401). *Benchmark, model, dense retriever, retrieval-augmented generation.*
5. **Make it concrete** — code it with the [HF Question Answering chapter](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter7/7). *Fine-tune a span-QA model on SQuAD.*
