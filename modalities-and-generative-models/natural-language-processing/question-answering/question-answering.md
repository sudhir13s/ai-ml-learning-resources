# Question Answering: from finding the span to grounding the answer

Ask a friend "When did Apollo 11 land on the Moon?" and three completely different things can happen depending on what they have in front of them. If they're holding a paragraph that *mentions* the landing, they'll scan it and **point at the words** — "right here: *July 20, 1969*." If they remember it from school, they'll just **say it from memory**. And if they have a library but no idea which book, they'll **go find the right page first, then read you the answer**. Those three reflexes — point at a span, recall from memory, retrieve-then-read — are *exactly* the three families of machine Question Answering, and almost every QA system you'll ever meet is one of them (or a blend).

QA is where representation learning stops being abstract and starts being *useful*: it's the task that turns "the model understands language" into "the model answered my question." It is also one of the most-asked NLP interview topics, because a single question — *"how would you build a QA system?"* — forces you to reason about reading comprehension, retrieval, generation, hallucination, and evaluation all at once. I'm going to walk it the way I'd teach a strong teammate from scratch: first the **problem** and its surprising number of shapes, then **extractive reading comprehension** (the SQuAD span head, derived from the logits up), then **abstaining** when there's no answer (SQuAD 2.0), then **open-domain** retrieve-then-read and **RAG**, then **closed-book** and **multi-hop** and **conversational** QA, then how we **score** any of it (EM/F1 and why generative answers break that), and finally **modern LLM QA** and its failure modes. By the end you'll be able to:

- name **what kind of QA** a problem is (by answer type *and* knowledge source) and pick the architecture from that cell;
- **derive** the BERT start/end span head and **compute a prediction by hand** from logits;
- explain how a model **abstains** on an unanswerable question (the `[CLS]` null score), and why SQuAD 2.0 needed it;
- explain the **retriever–reader** pipeline and how **RAG** grounds a generator in retrieved evidence;
- **score** a predicted answer with **Exact Match** and **token-level F1** by hand, and say why generative QA breaks both;
- reason about **modern LLM QA** — in-context, long-context, tool-use — and its failure modes (hallucination, lost-in-the-middle).

> **Note:** several pieces of this page are *deliberately* short because they each have their own deep page. The **encoder** QA fine-tunes on top of lives in [Contextual Embeddings (ELMo/BERT)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/contextual-embeddings-elmo-bert/contextual-embeddings-elmo-bert); the **retriever** half (BM25, DPR, dense vs lexical, ANN indexes) lives in [Information Retrieval & Semantic Search](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search); the **scoring** primitives live in [NLP Evaluation Metrics](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/nlp-evaluation-metrics/nlp-evaluation-metrics); the **generator** backbone lives in [Seq2Seq & Encoder–Decoder](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/sequence-to-sequence-and-encoder-decoder/sequence-to-sequence-and-encoder-decoder). This page is the **QA-specific glue** that ties them together — it points at those rather than re-deriving them.

## The problem: answer a natural-language question

The task sounds trivial — *given a question, return its answer* — but it hides a pile of decisions. Consider three questions:

- *"When did Apollo 11 land on the Moon?"* — a **factoid**: one short, factual answer.
- *"What does the passage say caused the 1929 crash, and how did the author feel about it?"* — a **reading-comprehension** question whose answer lives in a specific text.
- *"Earlier you mentioned the second mission — who commanded **it**?"* — a **conversational** follow-up whose meaning depends on the dialogue so far (note the dangling pronoun *it*).

To turn any of these into a concrete machine-learning problem you must answer **two orthogonal questions**, and the cross-product of the two is the entire design space:

1. **What shape is the answer?** A **span** copied verbatim from some text (*extractive*)? Freely **generated** words (*abstractive*)? A **choice** among options (*multiple-choice*)? A **yes/no** (*boolean*)?
2. **Where does the knowledge come from?** A **single given passage** (*reading comprehension*)? The model's own **parameters** (*closed-book*)? A **large corpus** the system must search (*open-domain*)?

![The QA design space as a grid: rows are answer type (extractive span / abstractive generation / multiple-choice or yes-no), columns are knowledge source (reading comprehension from a passage / closed-book from parameters / open-domain from a corpus). Each cell names the canonical benchmark or architecture — e.g. SQuAD with a BERT span head sits at extractive × reading-comprehension; RAG sits at abstractive × open-domain.](images/qa_taxonomy.png)

> **Tip:** in an interview, *always classify the question first.* "Is this extractive or generative? Reading-comprehension, closed-book, or open-domain?" pins down the architecture immediately — span head vs seq2seq, retriever-or-not — and shows the interviewer you see the whole map, not one model. The grid above *is* the answer to "how would you approach QA?"

The two axes really are independent. **Extractive open-domain** (DPR + a span reader) and **abstractive open-domain** (RAG) differ only in the *reader*; **extractive reading-comprehension** (plain SQuAD) and **extractive open-domain** differ only in whether a retriever sits in front. That modularity is why it pays to learn the pieces — span head, retriever, generator, scorer — once, then snap them together per cell.

---

## Family 1: extractive reading comprehension

The cleanest, most-studied corner of the grid is **extractive reading comprehension**: you're handed a **question** and a **passage that contains the answer**, and you must return the **shortest span of the passage** that answers it. No generation, no retrieval — just *point at the right words*. This is the **SQuAD** setup, and it's where modern QA was effectively solved, so it's worth getting exactly right.

> **Note:** **SQuAD** (Stanford Question Answering Dataset; [Rajpurkar et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)) is 100k+ crowd-written questions over Wikipedia paragraphs, where **every answer is a contiguous span of its paragraph**. Because the answer is always a substring, the model never has to *generate* — it only has to **locate**. That single design choice is what makes the task a clean, learnable pointing problem.

### The intuition: two pointers, not a vocabulary

Here's the move that makes extractive QA elegant. A generative model would have to choose the answer out of a 30,000-word vocabulary at every position — hard. But if the answer is *guaranteed to be a span of the passage*, you don't need a vocabulary at all. You only need to choose **two positions**: where the answer **starts** and where it **ends**. The answer is then just `passage[start : end+1]`. You've turned an open-ended generation problem into **two classification problems over passage positions** — and classification over a few hundred positions is far easier than generation over tens of thousands of words.

> **Tip:** this is the whole trick of extractive QA in one sentence: *"don't generate the answer — point at where it begins and where it ends."* Two softmaxes over the passage, and you're done.

### How BERT reads: one sequence, two segments

To use [BERT](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/contextual-embeddings-elmo-bert/contextual-embeddings-elmo-bert), we pack the question and passage into **one** input sequence, separated so the model knows which is which:

```
[CLS]  question tokens …  [SEP]  passage tokens …  [SEP]
```

BERT runs full **bidirectional** self-attention over the whole thing, so every passage token's final hidden vector $h_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is computed *with the question in view* — the representation of "1969" already "knows" you asked *when*. That question-aware contextualization is the entire reason a pretrained encoder is so good here; the span head on top is almost trivial by comparison.

The whole extractive-QA forward pass, end to end:

```

The only QA-specific parts are the two small heads ($\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{E}$) and the decode at the end; everything to the left is the pretrained encoder, untouched.

> **Note:** the `[CLS]` token (position 0) and the segment structure aren't decoration — `[CLS]` becomes the **no-answer** signal in SQuAD 2.0 (below), and the `[SEP]` boundary is how the model knows to only emit spans from the *passage* segment, never the question.

### Deriving the span head from scratch

Now the model itself. We learn exactly **two new vectors** — a **start vector** $\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ and an **end vector** $\mathbf{E} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ — and *that is the entire QA-specific parameter set added on top of BERT*. For every passage token $i$ with hidden state $h_i$, the **start score** and **end score** are simple dot products:

$$
\text{start\_logit}_i = \mathbf{S} \cdot h_i, \qquad \text{end\_logit}_i = \mathbf{E} \cdot h_i.
$$

> **Source / derivation:** the start/end span head is **§4.2 of [BERT (Devlin et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)** — "we only introduce a start vector $S$ and an end vector $E$ … the probability of word $i$ being the start of the answer span is computed as a dot product between $T_i$ and $S$ followed by a softmax." The task it solves is **[SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al. 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)**, which defined the answer-is-always-a-contiguous-span framing that makes a two-vector head sufficient.

Read that geometrically: $\mathbf{S}$ is a learned direction in embedding space that means *"I am the first word of an answer,"* and we score each token by **how much it points that way**. Same for $\mathbf{E}$ and *"I am the last word of an answer."* We then turn the scores into probability distributions over passage positions with a softmax:

$$
P_{\text{start}}(i) = \frac{e^{\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i}}{\sum_{k} e^{\mathbf{S}\cdot h_k}}, \qquad
P_{\text{end}}(j) = \frac{e^{\mathbf{E}\cdot h_j}}{\sum_{k} e^{\mathbf{E}\cdot h_k}}.
$$

To **predict**, we choose the span $(i, j)$ that maximizes the joint score, subject to $j \ge i$ (the end can't come before the start) and a small max-length cap:

$$
(\hat i, \hat j) = \operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\,j \ge i,\; j-i < L_{\max}} \; \big(\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i + \mathbf{E}\cdot h_j\big).
$$

> **Source / derivation:** the constrained span decode is **§4.2 of [BERT (Devlin et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)** — "the score of a candidate span from position $i$ to position $j$ is defined as $S\cdot T_i + E\cdot T_j$, and the maximum scoring span where $j \ge i$ is used as a prediction." The $j \ge i$ and length-cap constraints are exactly the official SQuAD-evaluation decode.

> **Note:** we maximize the **sum of logits** $\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i + \mathbf{E}\cdot h_j$, which is equivalent to maximizing the **product of probabilities** $P_{\text{start}}(i)\cdot P_{\text{end}}(j)$ because the two softmax denominators are constants for a given passage and $\log(ab) = \log a + \log b$. Working in logits avoids underflow and is what every implementation actually does.

> **Gotcha:** the $j \ge i$ constraint is **not optional**. The start and end heads are independent softmaxes — nothing stops `argmax(start)` from landing *after* `argmax(end)`, which would describe a negative-length span. The decode must enumerate valid $(i,j)$ pairs (typically the top-$k$ starts × top-$k$ ends, filtered to $j \ge i$ and $j-i < L_{\max}$), not just take the two independent argmaxes.

### Training the span head

Training is plain **cross-entropy on positions**. SQuAD gives you the gold start index $i^{*}$ and gold end index $j^{*}$; the loss is the sum of two negative log-likelihoods:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\tfrac{1}{2}\Big(\log P_{\text{start}}(i^{*}) + \log P_{\text{end}}(j^{*})\Big).
$$

> **Source / derivation:** the training objective is **§4.2 of [BERT (Devlin et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)** — "the training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions." It is two independent **position cross-entropies** (start and end), one over each softmax; the $\tfrac{1}{2}$ averages the two so the loss is on the same scale as a single cross-entropy. This is the standard fine-tuning recipe SQuAD ([Rajpurkar et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)) is trained with.

You backprop through $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{E}$, **and** all of BERT (full fine-tuning), and that's it — a couple of epochs over SQuAD turns a pretrained encoder into a strong reading-comprehension model. Devlin et al.'s [BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) reported this exact recipe beating the prior state of the art and approaching human performance on SQuAD 1.1.

> **Tip:** because the only new weights are two $d$-dimensional vectors, the span head is **tiny** — the heavy lifting is all in the pretrained encoder. This is the textbook example of "pretrain a general encoder, bolt on a task-specific head, fine-tune end-to-end."

### Seeing the head on a real passage

Here's the span head as it *actually* behaves, measured from a real fine-tuned model (`distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`) on the question *"Where is the Eiffel Tower located?"*:

![Two overlaid bar charts of probability over the passage tokens of "The Eiffel Tower is … on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France." The green start distribution spikes sharply on "Champ"; the red end distribution spikes on "France"; the predicted span between them is shaded. Almost all the probability mass sits on those two tokens — the head has learned to point.](images/qa_span_head.png)

Notice how *peaked* the distributions are: the start head puts its largest mass on **Champ** (≈0.52, with smaller bumps on the nearby "on"/"the") and the end head puts most of its mass on **France** (≈0.63), so $\arg\max P_{\text{start}}\cdot P_{\text{end}}$ cleanly selects the span **"Champ de Mars in Paris, France."** That confident, bimodal shape — one dominant green peak, one dominant red peak — is what a well-trained span head looks like.

---

## Worked example 1: predict a span by hand from logits

Let's do the decode arithmetic ourselves so the formula is concrete. Take a tiny passage tokenized as **[The, capital, of, France, is, Paris, .]** (positions 0–6) and the question *"What is the capital of France?"* Suppose BERT produced these start and end logits over the 7 passage positions:

| position $i$ | token   | $\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i$ (start) | $\mathbf{E}\cdot h_i$ (end) |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | The     | −2.0 | −3.0 |
| 1 | capital | −1.0 | −2.5 |
| 2 | of      | −3.0 | −3.0 |
| 3 | France  | −0.5 | −1.0 |
| 4 | is      | −2.0 | −2.0 |
| 5 | Paris   | **4.0** | **4.5** |
| 6 | .       | −1.0 | −0.5 |

**Step 1 — find the best valid span.** Enumerate $(i,j)$ with $j \ge i$ and score $= \text{start}_i + \text{end}_j$. The start head's max is position 5 (4.0) and the end head's max is also position 5 (4.5), and $5 \ge 5$ is valid, so the top span is $(5,5)$ with score $4.0 + 4.5 = 8.5$. The next best valid span, $(5,6)$ ("Paris ."), scores $4.0 + (-0.5) = 3.5$ — far lower. So the prediction is the single-token span **"Paris."**

**Step 2 — turn logits into a confidence.** Softmax the start logits. The dominant term is $e^{4.0}\approx 54.6$ against a sum of roughly $e^{-2}+e^{-1}+e^{-3}+e^{-0.5}+e^{-2}+e^{4}+e^{-1}\approx 0.14+0.37+0.05+0.61+0.14+54.6+0.37 \approx 56.3$, so $P_{\text{start}}(5)\approx 54.6/56.3 \approx \mathbf{0.970}$. The end head is even more peaked, $P_{\text{end}}(5)\approx 0.986$, giving a joint span probability $0.970 \times 0.986 \approx \mathbf{0.957}$. **High confidence, correct span** — and the code in the Code section computes exactly this 0.957.

![A two-row heatmap of the start logits (S·h_i) and end logits (E·h_j) over the seven passage tokens "The capital of France is Paris .". Almost every cell is pale (logits near −3 to −1); the two cells under "Paris" glow dark (4.0 and 4.5) and are boxed — start in green, end in red. This is the raw material of the decode: both heads point at the same token, so the argmax-pair span is the single token "Paris".](images/qa_span_logits_heatmap.png)

The heatmap above is the entire input to the decode: two rows of logits, one column per token. Reading off the two boxed cells — the brightest in each row — *is* the argmax-pair decode. Because both heads peak on the same position, the predicted span is the single token **"Paris."** When the start and end peaks land on *different* tokens (as in the Eiffel chart earlier, "Champ" … "France"), the span stretches between them.

To see why the $j \ge i$ constraint matters, picture the full **joint span-score matrix** — cell $(i,j)$ holding $\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i + \mathbf{E}\cdot h_j$, with the lower triangle ($j < i$) greyed out as illegal:

![A 7×7 heatmap of the joint span score start_i + end_j for every (start i, end j) pair over the same passage. The lower-left triangle (j < i, backwards spans) is greyed out as invalid. The single brightest valid cell, boxed in green and labelled "argmax", sits at (Paris, Paris) with score 8.5. The bright vertical band under the "Paris" end-column shows that ending on "Paris" scores well for many start positions, but only the (Paris, Paris) cell wins among valid spans.](images/qa_joint_span_score.png)

The decode is just *argmax over the upper triangle of this matrix*. The greyed lower triangle is the 21 illegal backwards spans the $j \ge i$ filter throws away; the boxed cell is the winner.

> **Note:** this is *exactly* what the measured Eiffel-Tower chart above shows numerically — one sharp start peak, one sharp end peak, and the argmax-pair decode lands on the right span. The hand example just lets you see the softmax produce the ~0.97 per-head peak (and the 0.957 joint) the bars depict.

> **Gotcha:** had the end head instead peaked at position 3 ("France", before "Paris"), the *naive* two-argmax decode would return the invalid span "France … Paris" running backwards. The $j \ge i$ filter forces the decoder to instead pick the best *valid* pair — this is why production code enumerates pairs rather than taking independent argmaxes.

---

## Worked example 2: a measured extractive QA over a real passage

Now the real thing end to end. Running the derived decode (best valid $(i,j)$ over the context tokens, $L_{\max}=30$) with `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` on the Apollo passage:

> *Passage:* "The Apollo 11 mission landed the first humans on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface while Michael Collins orbited above."

| question | predicted span | span score | null (`[CLS]`) score |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Who were the first humans to walk on the Moon? | **Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin** | 17.99 | −7.65 |
| When did Apollo 11 land on the Moon?           | **July 20, 1969**                  | 23.74 | −2.26 |
| Who stayed in orbit during Apollo 11?          | **Michael Collins**                | 20.05 | −5.26 |

All three correct, all three with a large positive span score and a deeply negative null score (we'll use that null score next). Notice the third question requires the model to resolve "stayed in orbit" → "orbited above" → **Michael Collins** — a small piece of reasoning, not a keyword match. That's the contextualized encoder earning its keep. The runnable code for this is in the **Code** section below.

> **Gotcha — the passage doesn't fit.** A BERT-style encoder has a hard input limit (typically **512 tokens**), so `[CLS] question [SEP] passage [SEP]` must fit inside it. A long document (a contract, a Wikipedia article) blows past 512, and naively truncating it can **cut off the very span that holds the answer** — a silent, unrecoverable failure. The standard fix is a **sliding window** with overlap (`doc_stride` in Hugging Face): split the document into overlapping chunks that each fit, run the span head on every chunk, and take the **global argmax of the span scores across chunks** — the same cross-passage argmax used in open-domain QA. The overlap matters: without it, an answer straddling a chunk boundary is split across two windows and found by neither. (Off-by-one in the chunk stride is a classic bug — too large a stride and you skip tokens, too small and you re-score the same span many times.)

---

## Family 1b: when there is no answer — SQuAD 2.0

SQuAD 1.1 has a hidden cheat: **every question is answerable**, so a model can guess a plausible-looking span and often be right by luck. Real systems face questions whose answer *isn't in the passage at all*, and a model that always returns its best guess will **confidently hallucinate**. [SQuAD 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822) (Rajpurkar et al. 2018) fixed this by adding **50k+ unanswerable questions** that look answerable — the right response is to **abstain**.

### Deriving the abstain mechanism

The elegant part is that abstaining needs **no new architecture** — it reuses the `[CLS]` token at position 0. Define a **null span** as "the answer is the `[CLS]` token," with score

$$
s_{\text{null}} = \mathbf{S}\cdot h_{\text{[CLS]}} + \mathbf{E}\cdot h_{\text{[CLS]}}.
$$

> **Source / derivation:** the null-span abstain mechanism is **[SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822)**, which introduced 50k+ unanswerable questions and the rule that a system must predict no-answer when the null score plus a threshold exceeds the best span score. The reuse of the **`[CLS]` position** as the null span is the standard BERT recipe ([Devlin et al. 2018, §4.2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) — training labels unanswerable examples with start = end = `[CLS]`.

Let $s_{\text{best}}$ be the score of the best *real* span found by the usual decode. The decision rule is a comparison (often with a tuned threshold $\tau$):

$$
\text{answer} =
\begin{cases}
\text{best span} & \text{if } s_{\text{best}} - s_{\text{null}} > \tau \\[2pt]
\text{abstain (no answer)} & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Training labels unanswerable examples with **start = end = `[CLS]` position**, so the model *learns* to put its mass on `[CLS]` when nothing in the passage answers the question. At inference you compare the best span against the null span and abstain if the span isn't enough better.

### Worked example 3: abstaining, measured

Here's the rule firing on a model trained for it (`deepset/roberta-base-squad2`), same Apollo passage. These four numbers are **reproduced exactly** by `abstain_demo()` in [`question_answering.py`](code/question_answering.py) — it loads the SQuAD-2.0 model and asserts each logit against the table below (and the notebook surfaces it in its own cell):

| question | best span | span score $s_{\text{best}}$ | null score $s_{\text{null}}$ | decision |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| What is the **diameter** of the Moon? | "lunar surface" | −6.59 | **1.04** | $s_{\text{null}} > s_{\text{best}}$ → **abstain** ✓ |
| Who were the first humans to walk on the Moon? | "Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin" | **16.64** | 4.81 | $s_{\text{best}} > s_{\text{null}}$ → **answer** ✓ |

The passage never gives the Moon's diameter, so the best span the model can scrape together ("lunar surface") scores a measly −6.59, *below* the null score of 1.04 — so the model **correctly says "no answer."** For the answerable question the real span scores 16.64, crushing the null, so it answers. Same model, same decode, one comparison decides between answering and abstaining.

> **Gotcha:** contrast this with a **SQuAD 1.1 model** on the same unanswerable question. A v1 model has no null option and *must* return its best span — on this passage it confidently coughs up "Apollo 11 mission landed the first humans on the Moon on July 20, 1969," a fluent, plausible, **completely wrong** answer. That failure mode — *can't say "I don't know"* — is precisely the bug SQuAD 2.0 was built to expose, and it's the ancestor of LLM hallucination.

> **Tip:** the threshold $\tau$ is a **precision/recall knob**. Raise it and the model abstains more (fewer wrong answers, but it stays silent on some answerable questions); lower it and it answers more (catches more, but hallucinates more). In a production QA bot, $\tau$ is what you tune to hit your "wrong-answer rate" budget.

## Family 2: open-domain QA — retrieve, then read

Reading comprehension assumes someone *hands you the passage*. Real questions don't come with a passage — *"Who painted the Mona Lisa?"* expects the system to **find** the relevant text in a huge corpus (all of Wikipedia, the whole web, your company's docs) and *then* answer. That's **open-domain QA**, and the dominant design is two stages — **retrieve, then read**:

![A horizontal pipeline: the question fans into a retriever (BM25 lexical or DPR dense) which looks up a corpus index (Wikipedia / FAISS), producing top-k passages of evidence; those passages feed either a reader (BERT span head, extractive) or a generator (seq2seq conditioned on the passages, RAG), which emits an answer plus a citation. Reader extracts a span; RAG generates conditioned on the evidence.](images/qa_retrieve_read.png)

1. **Retriever** — given the question, pull the top-$k$ most relevant passages from the corpus. This is an **information-retrieval** problem in its own right; see [Information Retrieval & Semantic Search](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search) for BM25, dense retrieval, ANN indexes, and reranking.
2. **Reader** — run an **extractive span head** (or a generator) over the retrieved passages and return the best answer, ideally with a pointer back to the source passage as a **citation**.

> **Note:** **DrQA** ([Chen et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051)) was the landmark first version: a **TF-IDF/bigram bag-of-words retriever** over Wikipedia feeding a neural span **reader**. It established the retrieve-then-read template that every open-domain system since has refined. Its weakness was the retriever — lexical overlap misses paraphrases ("car" ≠ "automobile").

> **Note:** **DPR** (Dense Passage Retrieval; [Karpukhin et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906)) replaced the lexical retriever with a **dense bi-encoder**: a question encoder and a passage encoder trained so a question's vector lands near its answer-bearing passages, retrieved by **maximum inner-product search** over a FAISS index. By matching *meaning* rather than surface words, DPR sharply raised retrieval recall — and thus end-to-end QA accuracy. The full dense-retrieval machinery (bi-encoder vs cross-encoder, ANN) is in the [IR page](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search).

> **Source / derivation:** the retrieve-then-read decomposition and the dense bi-encoder are **§3 of [DPR (Karpukhin et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906)** — the retriever similarity is the inner product $\text{sim}(q,p) = E_Q(q)^\top E_P(p)$ of a question encoder and a passage encoder, trained with an in-batch-negatives contrastive loss; the reader then runs the BERT span head over the top-$k$ retrieved passages. Our miniature retriever (a transparent bag-of-words cosine in [code](code/question_answering.py)) keeps the *same retrieve-by-similarity mechanics* with math you can verify by hand; lexical overlap is exactly the paraphrase weakness DPR's learned encoders were built to fix.

> **Gotcha:** open-domain accuracy is **bottlenecked by the retriever**. If the answer-bearing passage isn't in the top-$k$, the reader **cannot** recover it — a perfect reader scores zero on a question whose evidence was never retrieved. This is why so much open-domain QA research is really *retrieval* research, and why "retriever recall@k" is the metric to watch.

This bottleneck is a hard **ceiling**, not a soft penalty — end-to-end accuracy can never rise above retriever recall@k, no matter how good the reader is:

![A line chart with k (passages retrieved: 1, 3, 5, 10, 20) on the x-axis and accuracy on the y-axis. The blue "retriever recall@k" line rises from ~0.55 at k=1 to ~0.93 at k=20 — this is the ceiling. The green "end-to-end QA accuracy" line sits strictly below it (recall times an ~0.80 reader), with the gap between them shaded red and labelled "reader can only lose from here". The reader can never push end-to-end accuracy above the blue recall curve.](images/qa_retrieval_ceiling.png)

The blue line is a wall: every point on the green end-to-end curve lies *below* it, because the reader only ever *subtracts* from what the retriever surfaced. That is why raising $k$ (or training a better retriever) is usually the highest-leverage move in an open-domain QA system — and why retrieval recall is the first number to look at when accuracy is disappointing.

### A worked retrieve-then-read trace

Make it concrete with *"Who painted the Mona Lisa?"* against a Wikipedia corpus, $k=3$:

1. **Embed the question** (DPR question encoder) → a vector $q$. **Search** the FAISS index of passage vectors for the 3 nearest. Suppose they come back as: (a) the *Mona Lisa* article's lead paragraph ("…a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist **Leonardo da Vinci**…"), (b) a paragraph about the Louvre, (c) a paragraph about Renaissance portraiture. Passage (a) contains the answer — **recall@3 = hit.**
2. **Read.** Concatenate the question with each retrieved passage and run the **span head** on each. On passage (a), the start head peaks on "Leonardo" and the end head on "Vinci" with a high span score (say 14.2); on passages (b) and (c) the best spans score far lower (the answer isn't there). Take the **global argmax across passages**.
3. **Answer + cite.** Return **"Leonardo da Vinci"**, tagged with its source passage (a) as the citation.

Two failure points are now visible. If step 1 had ranked passage (a) *fourth*, it would fall outside $k=3$ and the system would answer wrongly from (b)/(c) — a **retrieval miss**, unrecoverable by any reader. And if two passages each contain a plausible-but-different answer, the cross-passage argmax has to arbitrate — which is why production readers normalize span scores across passages rather than trusting each in isolation.

> **Tip:** the *"global argmax across passages"* in step 2 is the piece beginners forget. A reader scores spans **per passage**; the system must then compare those scores **across** passages on one scale to pick the final answer. Mismatched score scales between passages are a classic open-domain bug — fix it by sharing the reader and comparing raw span scores, not per-passage softmaxes.

---

## Family 3: multiple-choice and yes/no QA

The two remaining answer shapes — **multiple-choice** and **boolean** — turn QA into **classification** rather than span-pointing, and they're worth a moment because they show up constantly (and in interviews).

**Multiple-choice** (benchmarks like **RACE**, **ARC**, **MMLU**): given a question and $n$ candidate answers, pick the best. The standard encoder recipe is to form $n$ inputs — `[CLS] question + option_i [SEP] passage [SEP]` — score each with a single logit head, and **softmax over the $n$ options**. You're classifying *which option*, not locating a span. With LLMs the modern version is even simpler: put the options in the prompt and read off the model's probability for each option letter, or just let it generate the letter.

**Yes/No (boolean)** QA (**BoolQ**): the answer is a single bit — does the passage support a *yes* or a *no*? This is a **binary classification** off the `[CLS]` representation, structurally identical to sentiment classification (see [Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/text-classification-and-sentiment-analysis/text-classification-and-sentiment-analysis)), just with a question + passage input instead of one sentence.

> **Note:** multiple-choice QA quietly dodges the **generation evaluation problem** — because the answer is one of $n$ fixed options, scoring is plain accuracy, no EM/F1/LLM-judge needed. That's exactly why benchmarks like **MMLU** are multiple-choice: it makes large-scale, unambiguous automatic grading of knowledge possible. The cost is that real questions rarely come with four neat options.

---

## Family 4: closed-book QA — the knowledge is in the weights

What if you delete the corpus *and* the passage and just ask the model? A large pretrained model like **T5** or **GPT** has read so much text during pretraining that a surprising amount of world knowledge is **baked into its parameters** — it can often answer factoid questions with no retrieval at all. This is **closed-book QA**: the model is the knowledge base.

[Roberts et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08910) showed T5 fine-tuned to answer questions *from its weights alone* is competitive with some open-book systems on factoid benchmarks — the model has effectively **memorized facts** during pretraining and learned to surface them on demand, and *larger* models memorize *more* (closed-book accuracy rose steadily from T5-Base to T5-11B, because more parameters store more facts).

The mechanism is worth picturing. During pretraining the model sees *"The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci"* thousands of times across the corpus; gradient descent nudges its weights so that, prompted with *"Who painted the Mona Lisa?"*, the most probable continuation is *"Leonardo da Vinci."* No lookup happens — the fact is **distributed across millions of weights**, reconstructed by the forward pass. That's powerful (instant, no index) and fragile (a rarely-seen fact may not have been stored, and the model can't tell you *whether* it was).

> **Tip:** closed-book is the **simplest** pipeline (no retriever, no index — just `model(question) → answer`) and the **fastest at serving time**, but it has three hard limits: it **can't cite** a source, its knowledge is **frozen** at the training cutoff (ask about last week and it can't know), and it **hallucinates** when the fact isn't actually in its weights — it generates something plausible-sounding regardless. Those three weaknesses are precisely what RAG was designed to fix.

> **Gotcha:** "the model knew the answer" and "the model guessed something fluent" are **indistinguishable from the output alone** in closed-book QA — both are confident, well-formed text. Without a source to check against, you cannot tell a recalled fact from a hallucination. That epistemic blind spot is the core argument for grounding answers in retrieved evidence.

---

## Family 5: RAG — retrieval-augmented generation

**RAG** ([Lewis et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)) is the open-domain pipeline with a **generator** as the reader instead of a span head. Retrieve the top-$k$ passages (as in DPR), then **condition a seq2seq generator** on the question *plus* those passages, and let it **write** the answer. It's the abstractive × open-domain cell of the grid.

The reason RAG dominates modern QA is that it gets the best of both worlds — and directly fixes closed-book's three weaknesses:

- **Less hallucination.** The generator is conditioned on real retrieved text, so it's anchored to evidence rather than free-associating from parameters. (It still *can* hallucinate — grounding reduces it, doesn't eliminate it.)
- **Citations.** Because the answer came from specific retrieved passages, you can **show the source** — essential for trust, fact-checking, and any application where "says who?" matters.
- **Fresh, swappable knowledge.** Update the **corpus**, not the weights — index this morning's news and the system can answer about it *with no retraining*. Closed-book can't do this at all.

> **Note:** RAG and **extractive** open-domain QA share the same front half (a retriever feeding a reader); they differ only in the reader — **extract a span** (verbatim, faithful, can't paraphrase) vs **generate** (fluent, can synthesize across passages, can drift). Extractive is safer when faithfulness is paramount; generative is better when the answer must combine or rephrase evidence. Many production systems run both and pick per query.

> **Tip:** the modern "chat with your documents" / enterprise-search product is, under the hood, almost always RAG: embed the docs into a vector index ([dense retrieval](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search)), retrieve per question, stuff the passages into an LLM's context with the question, and let it answer **with citations**. The deeper conceptual treatment is on the [Retrieval-Augmented Generation intuition page](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/memory-retrieval-and-context/retrieval-augmented-generation/rag-intuition).

## Multi-hop QA: chaining facts across documents

Some questions can't be answered from any single passage — you must **combine facts**. *"Which mission's command module pilot was born in Rome, Italy?"* requires finding the pilot (one document) **and** their birthplace (another) and **joining** them. That's **multi-hop reasoning**.

[HotpotQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09600) (Yang et al. 2018) is the benchmark: questions that explicitly require reasoning over **two or more** Wikipedia paragraphs, with annotated **supporting facts** so a system is graded not just on the answer but on whether it used the *right* evidence chain.

Trace the example. Hop 1: search *"Apollo 11 command module pilot"* → retrieve the Apollo 11 article → read out **"Michael Collins."** That fact wasn't in the original question, so hop 2 must **reformulate the query** using it: search *"Michael Collins astronaut birthplace"* → retrieve his biography → read **"born in Rome, Italy."** Now join: the question asked for the *mission*, so the answer is **Apollo 11.** Two retrievals, each query shaped by the previous read — that's the multi-hop loop.

> **Gotcha:** multi-hop breaks naive single-shot retrieve-then-read: the second hop's evidence is often **invisible to the first query** (you don't know to search for "Michael Collins birthplace" until you've already found his name). Real multi-hop systems do **iterative retrieval** — retrieve, read, *reformulate the query from what you learned*, retrieve again. This iterate-retrieve loop is the direct ancestor of modern **agentic / tool-using** QA, where an LLM decides what to search next.

> **Tip:** the **error compounds** across hops. If each retrieval step is 90% likely to surface the right evidence, a clean two-hop chain succeeds only $0.9 \times 0.9 \approx 81\%$ of the time, and three hops drop to ~73% — *before* any reader error. This multiplicative decay is why multi-hop QA is hard and why systems invest in high-recall retrieval and the ability to **backtrack** when a hop turns up nothing useful.

![A line chart with "number of reasoning hops" (1 to 5) on the x-axis and "probability the whole chain succeeds" on the y-axis. Three curves for per-hop retrieval recall p: green p=0.95 falling to 0.77 at hop 5, amber p=0.90 falling to 0.59, and red p=0.80 falling to 0.33. Each curve is p raised to the number of hops — even a strong 90%-per-hop retriever drops below 60% by five hops, before any reader error.](images/qa_multihop_compounding.png)

The curves are just $p^{\text{hops}}$: success multiplies, so even an excellent per-hop retriever decays fast. A 90%-per-hop system that feels reliable on single-hop questions falls to **59%** by hop 5 — which is why production multi-hop systems lean on high-recall retrieval, **backtracking**, and re-ranking rather than a single greedy chain.

---

## Conversational QA: questions in context

Real QA is rarely one-shot — it's a **conversation**, and follow-up questions lean on everything said before. **CoQA** ([Reddy et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07042)) and **QuAC** (Question Answering in Context) are the benchmarks: a dialogue of questions over a passage where later questions contain **coreference** ("who commanded **it**?") and **ellipsis** ("and **the third**?") that only resolve given the history.

The standard trick is to **fold the conversation history into the input** — prepend prior Q/A turns (or a rewritten, *de-contextualized* version of the current question) so the same span/generate machinery sees the full context. Resolving those dangling pronouns is itself a deep problem; see [Coreference Resolution](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/coreference-resolution/coreference-resolution).

> **Note:** **KBQA** (knowledge-base QA) is a different beast worth a one-liner: instead of reading text, it **translates the question into a structured query** (e.g. SPARQL over Wikidata) — *semantic parsing* — and executes it against a knowledge graph. It's precise and citable for questions a KB covers (*"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?"* → a database lookup), but limited to what's been structured into the graph. Modern LLM "tool use" generalizes this: the model writes a query/API call and runs it.

---

## Evaluation: Exact Match and token-level F1

How do you *score* a QA answer? For **extractive** SQuAD-style QA there are two standard metrics, and SQuAD reports **both** because each alone is misleading. Both first **normalize** the prediction and gold answer — lowercase, strip punctuation, drop the articles *a/an/the*, collapse whitespace — so trivial differences don't count.

**Exact Match (EM)** is all-or-nothing: 1 if the normalized prediction *equals* the normalized gold answer, else 0. **Token-level F1** gives **partial credit** by treating each answer as a **bag of tokens** and computing the overlap. With the predicted tokens $P$ and gold tokens $G$, and $n_{\text{same}} = $ the number of shared tokens (counting multiplicity):

$$
\text{precision} = \frac{n_{\text{same}}}{|P|}, \qquad
\text{recall} = \frac{n_{\text{same}}}{|G|}, \qquad
F_1 = \frac{2 \cdot \text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}.
$$

> **Source / derivation:** Exact Match and token-level F1 are the two official SQuAD metrics defined in **§6.1 of [SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al. 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)** — "Exact match … measures the percentage of predictions that match any one of the ground truth answers exactly. (Macro-averaged) F1 … measures the average overlap between the prediction and ground truth answer … treating the prediction and ground truth as bags of tokens." The normalization (lowercase, strip punctuation, drop *a/an/the*) is the official `evaluate-v2.0.py` scorer's, reproduced verbatim in our [code](code/question_answering.py).

> **Note:** when a SQuAD question has **multiple gold answers** (annotators don't always agree), the score is the **max** over golds — you get credit for matching *any* acceptable answer. The full metric machinery (EM/F1 internals, BLEU/ROUGE for generation) lives on the [NLP Evaluation Metrics page](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/nlp-evaluation-metrics/nlp-evaluation-metrics); here we only need them to score *answers*.

### Worked example 4: EM and F1 by hand

Take prediction **"Paris, France"** vs gold **"Paris"**.

**Step 1 — normalize.** Lowercasing and stripping the comma: prediction → tokens `["paris", "france"]`; gold → `["paris"]`.
**Step 2 — EM.** `["paris","france"] != ["paris"]` → **EM = 0**. (The extra word kills an exact match entirely — EM is brutal.)
**Step 3 — F1.** Shared tokens: just `"paris"`, so $n_{\text{same}} = 1$. Precision $= 1/2 = 0.5$ (the prediction has 2 tokens, 1 right), recall $= 1/1 = 1.0$ (it found the only gold token). $F_1 = 2(0.5)(1.0)/(0.5+1.0) = 1.0/1.5 = \mathbf{0.667}$.

So EM says "wrong" (0) but F1 says "two-thirds right" (0.667) — and the second is clearly the fairer verdict. Here are five measured pairs (computed by the SQuAD scorer in [`question_answering.py`](code/question_answering.py)):

![Horizontal bar chart comparing Exact Match (slate) and token-level F1 (green) for five prediction/gold pairs. "Paris, France" vs "Paris" gets EM=0 but F1=0.67; "the Champ de Mars" vs "Champ de Mars" gets EM=1, F1=1.00 (the article is normalized away); "Leonardo da Vinci" exact match scores 1/1.00; "1889" vs "in 1889" gets EM=0, F1=0.67; "London" vs "Paris" scores 0/0.00.](images/qa_em_f1.png)

| prediction | gold | EM | F1 | why |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| "Paris, France" | "Paris" | 0 | 0.67 | extra correct token, no exact match |
| "the Champ de Mars" | "Champ de Mars" | **1** | 1.00 | the article "the" is normalized away |
| "Leonardo da Vinci" | "Leonardo da Vinci" | 1 | 1.00 | identical |
| "1889" | "in 1889" | 0 | 0.67 | missing a token |
| "London" | "Paris" | 0 | 0.00 | no token overlap |

> **Tip:** the *"the Champ de Mars"* row is the one to remember: **normalization** (dropping *a/an/the* and punctuation) is why it scores a perfect EM=1 despite the literal strings differing. Forgetting normalization is the #1 reason a hand-computed SQuAD score disagrees with the official scorer.

### Why F1 is lenient and EM is brutal

The cleanest way to *feel* the difference between the two metrics is to take a correct answer and append extra (correct-but-unrequested) tokens one at a time. **EM dies at the very first extra token** — the strings no longer match exactly — but **F1 only sags slowly**, because recall stays pinned at 1.0 (you still said every gold token) while precision falls one token at a time:

![A line chart with "extra tokens appended to the correct answer 'Leonardo da Vinci'" on the x-axis (0 to 9) and score on the y-axis (0 to 1). The Exact Match line (slate) drops vertically from 1 to 0 at the first extra token and stays flat at 0. The token-F1 line (green) starts at 1.0 and decays smoothly — 0.86, 0.75, 0.67, 0.60 … — crossing a dashed red "F1=0.5" line around 6 extra tokens. The gap between the two lines is F1's leniency made visible.](images/qa_em_f1_leniency.png)

That smooth green decay versus the cliff-edge slate drop *is* the leniency of F1: a verbose-but-correct answer keeps most of its F1 while scoring a flat zero on EM. This is precisely why SQuAD reports **both** — EM alone is too harsh on answers that are right but not phrased canonically, and F1 alone would over-reward answers padded with correct filler. (The decay is monotonic by construction — the notebook asserts it.)

### Why generative QA breaks EM/F1

EM and F1 assume the answer is a **short, canonical span**. They fall apart on **generative** answers, where a correct answer can be phrased a thousand ways: *"It was painted by Leonardo da Vinci"* vs gold *"Leonardo da Vinci"* shares only some tokens, so F1 unfairly punishes a perfectly correct, more verbose answer. Worse, EM is essentially always 0 for free-form text.

> **Gotcha:** this is the **open evaluation problem** of modern generative QA. Token-overlap metrics (EM/F1, and even BLEU/ROUGE) systematically under-credit correct-but-differently-worded answers and can over-credit fluent-but-wrong ones. The field has moved toward **model-based judging** — an **LLM-as-judge** scores whether the generated answer is *correct and grounded* given the question and evidence — and human eval for high-stakes settings. There is no clean closed-form metric for "is this generated answer right?", and that's a live research problem.

## Modern LLM QA: in-context, long-context, tool use

Today, much QA is *one prompt to an LLM*. Three patterns dominate, each mapping onto a family above:

- **In-context / few-shot QA.** Put the question (and optionally a few example Q/A pairs) in the prompt; the LLM answers from its parameters. This is **closed-book QA** with no fine-tuning — and inherits closed-book's hallucination and staleness.
- **Long-context "answer from the document."** Paste the whole document (or many retrieved passages) into the LLM's context window and ask. This is **reading comprehension** / RAG at scale — the dominant "chat with your PDF" pattern — leaning on long-context models that can hold tens of thousands of tokens.
- **Tool-use / agentic QA.** Let the LLM **decide** to call a retriever, a search API, a database, or a calculator, read the result, and answer — generalizing both RAG (retrieval as a tool) and multi-hop (iterate: search, read, search again). This is where the iterative-retrieval idea from multi-hop QA grows up.

> **Gotcha — hallucination.** An LLM answering closed-book (or with weak/irrelevant retrieval) produces **fluent, confident, sometimes wrong** answers — the SQuAD-1.1 "can't say I don't know" failure, scaled up. The mitigations are exactly the families above: **ground** the answer in retrieved evidence (RAG), **demand citations** so claims are checkable, and let the model **abstain** ("I don't know") when evidence is thin — the SQuAD-2.0 null-answer instinct, re-learned.

> **Gotcha — lost in the middle.** Long-context LLMs don't attend uniformly: [Liu et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) found accuracy is highest when the relevant passage sits at the **beginning or end** of the context and **sags in the middle** — a U-shaped curve. So "just paste everything in" is *not* free: a great retriever that ranks the answer-bearing passage **first** still matters even with a huge context window. Long context doesn't make retrieval obsolete; it makes *good ordering* matter.

> **Tip:** the through-line of this whole page: every modern QA trick is a re-invention of a classical idea. RAG = retrieve-then-read (DrQA) with a generative reader; tool-use QA = iterative multi-hop retrieval; "I don't know" = the SQuAD-2.0 null answer; citations = the supporting-facts supervision of HotpotQA. Knowing the lineage is what lets you reason about the new systems instead of memorizing them.

---

## Where QA shows up in production

It's worth grounding all this in the systems you actually use, because each maps cleanly onto a family above:

- **Web search "answer boxes."** When a search engine shows a direct snippet at the top of the results — *"the Eiffel Tower is 330 m tall"* — that's **open-domain extractive QA**: retrieve candidate pages, run a span reader, surface the best span with its source. The citation (the linked page) is non-negotiable here precisely because of the hallucination risk.
- **Enterprise / document search and support bots.** "Chat with your docs," internal knowledge-base assistants, and customer-support copilots are **RAG**: embed the corpus, retrieve per question, condition an LLM, answer **with citations** so an agent (or auditor) can verify. The whole value proposition — *grounded, current, attributable* — is the three RAG wins.
- **Voice assistants.** "When does the pharmacy close?" is a factoid that blends **closed-book** (the assistant's parametric knowledge for common facts) with **tool-use** (a live lookup for anything fresh or local) — the modern agentic blend.
- **Reading-comprehension features.** "Highlight the answer in this contract," "summarize what this clause says about liability" — **extractive reading comprehension** over a single given document, the cleanest SQuAD-shaped task.

> **Note:** notice that *every* production system above either **retrieves** or **abstains** (or both). The pure closed-book pattern — answer from weights, no source, no abstention — survives only where being occasionally-confidently-wrong is acceptable. For anything where a wrong answer has a cost, the design pressure is always toward **grounding** and **the ability to say "I don't know."** That's the single most important practical lesson of QA.

## Code: extractive QA and SQuAD scoring, verified

> **Runnable project and a step-by-step notebook:** every number on this page comes from one seeded source of truth that lives next to it — see the [step-by-step teaching notebook](code/question-answering.ipynb) and the [runnable demo script](code/question_answering.py) (run it with `python question_answering.py`). The same functions also generate every figure on this page, via [`make_figures_11.py`](code/make_figures_11.py) — so the prose, the notebook, and the charts cannot drift apart. The notebook runs **fully offline**: it uses a real fine-tuned SQuAD model if one is cached, and a deterministic synthetic span model otherwise.

Two self-contained blocks below, both verified on Python 3.12 (`torch` 2.12, `transformers` 5.10, `numpy` 2.4). The first runs the **derived span decode** on a real model; the second is the **SQuAD EM/F1 scorer** computing the worked-example numbers exactly.

for q in ["Who were the first humans to walk on the Moon?",
          "When did Apollo 11 land on the Moon?",
          "Who stayed in orbit during Apollo 11?"]:
    a, s = answer(q, passage)
    print(f"{a:35s}  (span score {s:5.2f})  <- {q}")
```

Output:

```
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin       (span score 17.99)  <- Who were the first humans to walk on the Moon?
July 20, 1969                        (span score 23.74)  <- When did Apollo 11 land on the Moon?
Michael Collins                      (span score 20.05)  <- Who stayed in orbit during Apollo 11?
```

All three correct — and the decode is *exactly* the $\arg\max_{j\ge i}(\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i + \mathbf{E}\cdot h_j)$ rule we derived, no library QA helper.

```python
"""SQuAD-style EM and token-level F1, from the definitions. Reproduces the worked example."""
import re, string

def normalize(s):                                  # lowercase, drop punctuation + articles, collapse ws
    s = s.lower()
    s = "".join(ch for ch in s if ch not in set(string.punctuation))
    s = re.sub(r"\b(a|an|the)\b", " ", s)
    return " ".join(s.split())

def em(pred, gold):
    return float(normalize(pred) == normalize(gold))

def f1(pred, gold):
    p, g = normalize(pred).split(), normalize(gold).split()
    if not p or not g:
        return float(p == g)
    same = sum(min(p.count(t), g.count(t)) for t in set(p) & set(g))   # shared tokens w/ multiplicity
    if same == 0:
        return 0.0
    prec, rec = same / len(p), same / len(g)
    return 2 * prec * rec / (prec + rec)

for pred, gold in [("Paris, France", "Paris"), ("the Champ de Mars", "Champ de Mars"),
                   ("Leonardo da Vinci", "Leonardo da Vinci"), ("1889", "in 1889"), ("London", "Paris")]:
    print(f"EM={em(pred, gold):.0f}  F1={f1(pred, gold):.3f}   {pred!r:20s} vs {gold!r}")
```

Output:

```
EM=0  F1=0.667   'Paris, France'      vs 'Paris'
EM=1  F1=1.000   'the Champ de Mars'  vs 'Champ de Mars'
EM=1  F1=1.000   'Leonardo da Vinci'  vs 'Leonardo da Vinci'
EM=0  F1=0.667   '1889'               vs 'in 1889'
EM=0  F1=0.000   'London'             vs 'Paris'
```

The numbers match Worked Example 4 exactly — including the *"the Champ de Mars"* row scoring a perfect EM=1 *because* normalization drops the article.

> **Tip:** to abstain (SQuAD 2.0 style), add the null span to the decode: compute $s_{\text{null}} = \text{start}_{\text{[CLS]}} + \text{end}_{\text{[CLS]}}$ (position 0) and return "no answer" when $s_{\text{best}} - s_{\text{null}} \le \tau$. Swap in a v2 model like `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` and you reproduce Worked Example 3.

Read it top-down: *is the answer in text I'm given?* splits reading-comprehension from the rest; *where's the knowledge?* splits closed-book from open-domain; *verbatim or synthesized?* splits an extractive reader from RAG; and the two red branches add the cross-cutting upgrades — **abstaining** (SQuAD 2.0) and **multi-hop/agentic** iteration. Every box is a family from this page.

## Recap and rapid-fire

**If you remember nothing else:** QA has two axes — **answer shape** (extractive span / abstractive / multiple-choice / yes-no) and **knowledge source** (reading-comprehension / closed-book / open-domain) — and the cell picks the architecture. Extractive QA turns answering into **pointing**: learn a start vector $\mathbf{S}$ and end vector $\mathbf{E}$, score each token by $\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i$ and $\mathbf{E}\cdot h_j$, softmax over passage positions, and return $\arg\max_{j\ge i}(\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i + \mathbf{E}\cdot h_j)$. Abstaining (SQuAD 2.0) compares the best span against the `[CLS]` **null span**. Open-domain QA is **retrieve-then-read** (DrQA → DPR); **RAG** swaps the reader for a generator to get fresh, citable, less-hallucinated answers. We score with **EM** (all-or-nothing) and **token-F1** (partial credit) — both of which break on generative answers, the open evaluation problem.

**Quick-fire — say these out loud:**

- *Extractive vs abstractive QA?* Extractive predicts a **span** of a passage (copy); abstractive **generates** the answer (can synthesize/rephrase).
- *Why predict start and end instead of generating?* The answer is guaranteed to be a span, so you only need **two position classifiers**, not a vocabulary.
- *The span head's parameters?* Two learned vectors, $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{E}$; logits are $\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i$ and $\mathbf{E}\cdot h_j$, softmaxed over positions.
- *Predicted span?* $\arg\max_{j\ge i,\,j-i<L}(\mathbf{S}\cdot h_i + \mathbf{E}\cdot h_j)$ — the **$j\ge i$** constraint is essential.
- *SQuAD 1.1 vs 2.0?* 2.0 adds **unanswerable** questions; the model must **abstain** via the `[CLS]` null-span score.
- *Reading-comp vs closed-book vs open-domain?* Answer from a **given passage** / from the **model's parameters** / from a **retrieved corpus**.
- *Retrieve-then-read?* Retriever (BM25/DPR) pulls top-$k$ passages; a reader (span head or RAG generator) answers from them.
- *Why RAG over closed-book?* **Fresh knowledge** (update the corpus, not the weights), **citations**, and **less hallucination** (grounded in evidence).
- *Multi-hop QA?* Answer needs facts from **multiple documents** (HotpotQA); naive single-shot retrieval misses the later hops.
- *EM vs F1?* EM = exact (after normalization); F1 = token-overlap **partial credit**; SQuAD reports both, max over gold answers.
- *Biggest modern failure modes?* **Hallucination** (confident-but-wrong, the SQuAD-1.1 disease) and **lost-in-the-middle** (long-context accuracy sags for mid-context evidence).
