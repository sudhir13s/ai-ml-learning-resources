# Machine Translation — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Machine Translation](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/machine-translation/machine-translation)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity, and every link verified.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Seq2Seq Encoder–Decoder Neural Networks, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8HKweZIOmg) (**StatQuest, Josh Starmer**). *The translation pipeline, gently, before any attention.*
2. **See attention fix MT** — read ⭐ [Visualizing A Neural Machine Translation Model](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) (**Jay Alammar**), then watch [Stanford CS224N Lec 7 — Translation, Seq2Seq, Attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzfWHP6SXxY). *Watch the single-vector bottleneck appear and attention remove it.*
3. **Get the math (and the metric)** — read [SLP3 Ch. 13 "Machine Translation"](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/13.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *Encoder–decoder MT, beam search, and BLEU, rigorously and free.*
4. **Understand evaluation** — read the original [BLEU paper](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040/) (**Papineni et al. 2002**) and the [sacreBLEU "Call for Clarity"](https://aclanthology.org/W18-6319/) (**Post 2018**). *The metric that ran the field, and why you must report it carefully.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run the [opus-mt-fr-en](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-fr-en) model and the from-scratch BLEU in this chapter's [notebook](code/machine-translation.ipynb), or the [TensorFlow NMT-with-attention tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/nmt_with_attention). *Translate, then score.*
