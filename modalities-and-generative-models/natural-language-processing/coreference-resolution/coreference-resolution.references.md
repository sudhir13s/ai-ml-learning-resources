# Coreference Resolution — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Coreference Resolution](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/coreference-resolution/coreference-resolution)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal cross-links, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first; every entry is a primary author or recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on coreference, not popularity. Links verified.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame the task** — read [SLP3 Ch. 23 "Coreference Resolution and Entity Linking"](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/23.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *Mentions, chains, anaphora, and all three metrics — the definitive write-up.*
2. **See the phenomena** — watch [Anaphora and Coreference Resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaN8kJ7JeY0) (**IIT Madras**). *Why pronouns and definite descriptions are hard.*
3. **Get the modern model** — watch [Stanford CS224N Lec 13 — Coreference Resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpwEWLaueRk) (**Stanford, Manning**). *Mention-pair → mention-ranking → end-to-end neural coref.*
4. **Read the source** — [End-to-end Neural Coreference Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07045) (**Lee et al., 2017**). *Span enumeration + ranking, no pipeline — derive the loss.*
5. **Make it concrete** — try [fastcoref](https://github.com/shon-otmazgin/fastcoref) (**Otmazgin et al.**) or prompt an LLM. *Resolve coreference clusters on real text.*
