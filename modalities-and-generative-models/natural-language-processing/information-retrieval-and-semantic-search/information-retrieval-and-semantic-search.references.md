# Information Retrieval & Semantic Search — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Information Retrieval & Semantic Search](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/modalities-and-generative-models/natural-language-processing/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search/information-retrieval-and-semantic-search)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author (the paper's authors) or a recognized deep explainer, chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame lexical vs semantic** — read [What is semantic search?](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/semantic-search) (**Elastic**). *The clearest plain-English split between term-overlap and meaning-based retrieval.*
2. **Get the lexical baseline** — read [Scoring, term weighting & the vector space model](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/scoring-term-weighting-and-the-vector-space-model-1.html) (**Manning IR Book**). *TF-IDF/BM25 ranking, the classical baseline you must beat.*
3. **See semantic search in code** — watch [Sentence Transformers: Semantic Search & Clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlhNZg4gOvA) (**Pradip Nichite**) and read the [SBERT semantic-search guide](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html). *Bi-encoder retrieval + cross-encoder rerank, end to end.*
4. **Read the dense-retrieval source** — [Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) (**Karpukhin et al., 2020**). *The contrastive dual-encoder + in-batch negatives, derived on the page.*
5. **Connect to RAG** — read [SLP3 Ch. 14: Question Answering, Information Retrieval, and RAG](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *IR + dense retrieval + RAG in the standard text.*
