# Optimal Transport — Wasserstein Distances
> The mathematics of moving one probability distribution onto another at minimum cost: the
> Monge and Kantorovich formulations, the Wasserstein distance (a true metric on distributions that
> respects geometry), Kantorovich–Rubinstein duality, Brenier's theorem, and the entropic-regularized
> Sinkhorn algorithm that made OT computationally practical for ML.

**Why it matters:** the Wasserstein distance is the math under WGAN (and its weight-clipping /
gradient-penalty fixes), flow matching, domain adaptation, and distribution-shift metrics. Unlike KL,
it's finite and meaningful even for non-overlapping supports — which is *exactly* why it stabilizes
generative training. Kantorovich duality is a flagship use of the convex duality from card 4.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the intuition** — watch [A Primer on Optimal Transport, Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iR1E6t1MMQ) (Cuturi). *Monge → Kantorovich → Wasserstein, the conceptual ladder.*
2. **See the duality** — watch [Linking the Theory and Practice of Optimal Transport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiLS8JXJXig) (Solomon). *Kantorovich–Rubinstein duality, the form WGAN uses.*
3. **Read the reference** — work [Computational Optimal Transport, Ch. 2–4](https://optimaltransport.github.io/book/) (Peyré & Cuturi). *The free, definitive text: formulations, duality, Sinkhorn.*
4. **Understand Sinkhorn** — study the entropic-regularization chapter and the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00567). *Entropic OT is what makes Wasserstein differentiable and GPU-friendly.*
5. **Connect to generative models** — read [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875), then watch [a deeper OT-for-ML talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1CeOJdQQrc). *Where OT actually lives in modern ML research.*
