# Differential Geometry & Manifolds
> The calculus of curved spaces: smooth manifolds (spaces that look locally like ℝⁿ), tangent spaces,
> Riemannian metrics, geodesics, and optimization *on* manifolds. The language behind the manifold
> hypothesis, t-SNE/UMAP, natural gradients (info geometry), and constrained optimization where the
> feasible set is itself a curved surface (orthogonal matrices, the simplex, low-rank manifolds).

**Why it matters:** "real data lives on a low-dimensional manifold" is a load-bearing assumption in
representation learning — and Riemannian optimization (gradient on the tangent space, then retract
back) is how you train with hard geometric constraints (Stiefel/Grassmann manifolds, hyperbolic
embeddings). This card supplies the tangent-space/metric vocabulary that information geometry (card 8)
and geometric deep learning (card 11) reuse.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build manifold intuition** — watch [Manifolds, Tangent Spaces, and Coordinate Basis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys_8Ty_I5XI). *"Locally like ℝⁿ" plus the tangent space, visually.*
2. **Nail the tangent space** — watch [Differential structures: tangent vector spaces (Schuller, Lec 09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPGoXBfm6Js). *The rigorous definition — derivations vs curves — that everything else builds on.*
3. **Read a gentle text** — work [MML Ch. 3 (geometry) + Pennsylvania's Riemannian notes, early chapters](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis6100/Riemann.pdf). *Metrics, geodesics, and the exponential map.*
4. **See it in ML** — connect to the manifold hypothesis via the [t-SNE/UMAP intuition](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/representation/dimensionality-and-latent-structure/tsne-and-umap-intuition.md). *Where "data on a manifold" stops being a metaphor.*
5. **Optimize on manifolds** — read the Riemannian-optimization chapter (gradient → retraction), then bridge to [information geometry](../information-geometry/information-geometry.md). *Natural gradient is Riemannian gradient descent on a statistical manifold.*
