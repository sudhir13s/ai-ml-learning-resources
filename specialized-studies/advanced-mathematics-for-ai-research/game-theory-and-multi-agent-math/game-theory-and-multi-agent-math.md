# Game Theory & Multi-Agent Math
> The mathematics of strategic interaction among rational agents: normal- and extensive-form games,
> dominant strategies, **Nash equilibrium** (and its existence via fixed-point theorems), mixed
> strategies, minimax/zero-sum duality, correlated equilibria, and the learning dynamics
> (no-regret, fictitious play) by which agents *reach* equilibria. The decision-theoretic backbone of
> multi-agent RL, mechanism design, and adversarial training.

**Why it matters:** GAN training is a two-player minimax game (and its instabilities are
equilibrium-finding instabilities); adversarial robustness is a game against a perturbing adversary;
multi-agent RL, self-play (AlphaGo/AlphaZero), and RLHF reward modeling all live here. Minimax duality
ties straight back to convex duality (card 4), and "what is a Nash equilibrium, and why does one
always exist?" is a recurring interview question.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the five core ideas** — watch [Yale ECON-159, Lecture 1: five first lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM3rTU927io). *Dominance, best response, and why rational play can be self-defeating.*
2. **Nail Nash equilibrium** — watch [Game Theory 101 (#5): What Is a Nash Equilibrium?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TcYV6CZ7mI). *The single most important solution concept, cleanly.*
3. **See mixed strategies** — watch [What Is a Nash Equilibrium? (Stoplight Game)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7p9DNvtjk). *Why randomizing can be optimal — the bridge to minimax.*
4. **Read the reference** — work [Multiagent Systems (Shoham & Leyton-Brown), Ch. 3–5](https://www.masfoundations.org/mas.pdf). *Normal/extensive games, equilibria, and computation, the free standard text.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) and link to [bandits/RL](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/readme). *Minimax games, self-play, and learning dynamics in modern ML.*
