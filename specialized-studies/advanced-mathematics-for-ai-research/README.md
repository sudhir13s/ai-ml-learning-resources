# 🔬 Advanced Research Mathematics — Curriculum (Specialization)
> Elective deep-dive track for research-grade ML math, absorbed and expanded from the retired
> `math-for-AIML-Q5` research specialization. This is the *third tier*: study after the
> [main curriculum's](../../foundations/mathematical-foundations/maths-for-ai-ml/README.md) phases and the corresponding
> [ai-ml-intuitions](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/) modules. Each row names the payoff that justifies it.

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) with its gold-standard resource
card — a short guided learning path plus the best **free, open** graduate / research-level courses,
lectures, key papers, articles, and book chapters for that topic. This domain owns the
*graduate / research-level* treatment; the *basics* (linear algebra, calculus, core probability,
entropy/KL) live in [Foundations](../../foundations/mathematical-foundations/README.md). Treat each card like a semester,
not an afternoon.

### How to use this track
- **Don't read it linearly.** Pick the track your current work touches (building GNNs → R8;
  diffusion research → R11; theory-flavored interviews → R2 + R9).
- Each track is *months*, not weeks — treat a track like a graduate seminar: anchor text +
  3–4 key papers + one implementation.
- The highest-leverage single track for most ML engineers: **R2 (concentration)** — it turns
  "the model seems to generalize" into statements with error bars.
