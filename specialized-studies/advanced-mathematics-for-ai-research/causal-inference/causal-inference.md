# Causal Inference
> The mathematics of *cause*, not just correlation: structural causal models (SCMs), causal DAGs, the
> do-operator, the backdoor and frontdoor adjustment criteria, do-calculus, counterfactuals, and the
> potential-outcomes (Neyman–Rubin) framework. The tools that answer "what *would* happen if we
> intervened?" — a strictly harder question than prediction.

**Why it matters:** observational ML predicts P(Y | X); causal inference targets P(Y | do(X)) — the
basis of A/B-test reasoning, confounding control, off-policy evaluation in RL, fairness, and robust
ML under distribution shift. "Correlation isn't causation — so when *can* you infer causation from
data?" is exactly what the backdoor criterion and do-calculus answer, and it's a rising interview
topic for applied/research roles.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get oriented** — watch [A Brief Introduction to Causal Inference (Course Preview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXBPtpBhGqo) (Brady Neal). *Why prediction ≠ intervention, and what the field is about.*
2. **See the two frameworks** — watch [VMLW 2021: A brief introduction to causal inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8HFNel9xpU). *SCM/do-calculus vs potential outcomes, reconciled.*
3. **Read the course** — work [Brady Neal's Introduction to Causal Inference (free book)](https://www.bradyneal.com/Introduction_to_Causal_Inference-Dec17_2020-Neal.pdf). *DAGs, backdoor/frontdoor, do-calculus, identification — the best free ML-flavored text.*
4. **Master adjustment** — focus on the backdoor criterion and do-calculus chapters; read [Pearl's Causal Inference: an overview](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf). *Identification is the central technical skill.*
5. **Connect to ML & decisions** — watch [1.1 Intro & Outline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfzO4IEMVUk) and link to bandits/RL via the [Game Theory card](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/specialized-studies/advanced-mathematics-for-ai-research/game-theory-and-multi-agent-math/game-theory-and-multi-agent-math). *Causality underpins off-policy evaluation and counterfactual learning.*
