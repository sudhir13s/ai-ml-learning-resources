# Measure Theory & Probability Foundations
> The rigorous foundation under all of probability: σ-algebras, measures, the Lebesgue integral, and
> the measure-theoretic definition of a random variable, expectation, and conditional expectation.
> This is what lets you say *exactly* what "almost surely", "converges in distribution", and
> "E[X | 𝓕]" mean — and prove the LLN, CLT, and martingale theorems instead of waving at them.

**Why it matters:** every concentration inequality, generalization bound, SDE-view of diffusion,
and martingale argument in ML rests on this. You won't be asked to *quote* Carathéodory in an
interview, but the difference between an engineer who "knows the CLT" and one who knows *why it has
teeth* (convergence modes, Borel–Cantelli, dominated convergence) is exactly this layer.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See why Riemann isn't enough** — watch [Measure Theoretic Probability, Lesson 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swa1VRYms3Q). *Motivates σ-fields and measures before any heavy machinery.*
2. **Get the core objects** — read Tao's [Introduction to Measure Theory, Ch. 1](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/an-introduction-to-measure-theory/). *σ-algebras → measures → measurable functions → the Lebesgue integral, the four pillars.*
3. **Connect to probability** — work [Roch's grad-prob notes, §1–2](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~roch/grad-prob/). *Sees a random variable as a measurable map and E[X] as an integral — the reframe that unlocks everything.*
4. **Master the convergence zoo** — study Borel–Cantelli, dominated/monotone convergence, and the modes of convergence in [Lalley's notes](http://galton.uchicago.edu/~lalley/Courses/381/measure.pdf). *This is the part that actually shows up in proofs you'll read.*
5. **Climb to the payoff** — watch [Lesson 11: The Borel–Cantelli Lemmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjtRnojwDA4), then push toward the strong LLN and martingale convergence. *Where measure theory starts paying rent in ML theory.*
