# Fourier Analysis & Signal Processing
> Decompose signals into frequencies: Fourier series, the Fourier transform, the DFT and the FFT, plus
> convolution, sampling (Nyquist), and the time–frequency view (spectrograms, wavelets). The Fourier
> basis diagonalizes convolution and shift-invariant operators — which is exactly *why* CNNs,
> positional encodings, spectral GNNs, and diffusion's frequency analysis all speak Fourier.

**Why it matters:** the convolution theorem ("convolution in time = multiplication in frequency") is
the conceptual root of convolutional layers and the O(n log n) FFT; sinusoidal positional encodings
are a direct Fourier idea; Fourier features and the spectral bias of neural nets explain *what
frequencies networks learn first*. This card also feeds the graph-Fourier basis in spectral graph
theory (card 11).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See it visually** — watch [But what is the Fourier Transform?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) (3Blue1Brown). *The winding-machine picture that makes the transform intuitive.*
2. **Understand series** — watch [But what is a Fourier series?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) (3Blue1Brown). *From heat flow to "any signal is a sum of rotations".*
3. **Get the engineering view** — watch [The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8HeD-MUrjY) (Brunton) and read [databookuw Ch. 2](https://databookuw.com/). *DFT/FFT and the convolution theorem you'll actually compute with.*
4. **Read the rigorous course** — work [Stanford EE261 (The Fourier Transform and its Applications)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE261). *The definitive engineering-math treatment: transform, sampling, DFT.*
5. **Reach ML applications** — connect to [positional encodings](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/representation/embedding-spaces/positional-representations-intuition.md) and Fourier features. *Where Fourier analysis shows up directly in modern architectures.*
