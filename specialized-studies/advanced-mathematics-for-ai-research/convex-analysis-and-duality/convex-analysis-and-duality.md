# Convex Analysis & Duality
> The graduate treatment of convexity: convex sets and functions, subgradients, conjugate
> (Fenchel) duality, Lagrangian duality, KKT conditions, and strong duality. The theory that turns a
> hard primal problem into a (sometimes easier) dual, certifies optimality, and underpins SVMs,
> mirror descent, proximal methods, and min–max/saddle-point training (GANs, adversarial robustness).

**Why it matters:** "derive the SVM dual", "what do the KKT conditions say at the optimum", and
"why is the dual always convex" are recurring theory questions. Duality is also the conceptual root of
the Lagrangian-penalty view of constraints, the Fenchel-conjugate view of mirror descent, and the
saddle-point framing of GANs and Wasserstein distances (card 9).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Lock in convex sets & functions** — watch [Stanford EE364A Lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV1ru-Inzl4) (Boyd). *Convexity is the property that makes everything that follows tractable.*
2. **Get duality** — watch [Convex Optimization I, Lecture 8: Duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJVmflArCXc) (Boyd). *The Lagrangian, the dual function, weak/strong duality — the core of the card.*
3. **Read the canonical text** — work [Boyd & Vandenberghe Ch. 5 (Duality)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf). *The reference everyone cites; do the SVM/LP dual examples.*
4. **See KKT in action** — derive the KKT conditions and apply them to the SVM dual using the [EE364A course page](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) problem sets. *Optimality conditions become intuition only after you use them.*
5. **Generalize to conjugates** — read the Fenchel-conjugate sections, then connect to mirror descent in [Tibshirani's convex-optimization notes](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-F16/). *Conjugate duality is the modern, scalable face of this theory.*
