# Spectral Graph Theory
> Read a graph through the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its matrices — the adjacency matrix and,
> above all, the **graph Laplacian** `L = D − A`. The spectrum encodes connectivity (the Fiedler
> value λ₂), bottlenecks (Cheeger's inequality), and a natural Fourier basis on graphs. It's the
> mathematics under spectral clustering, graph signal processing, and the spectral view of GNNs.

**Why it matters:** spectral clustering ("partition by the Fiedler vector") and graph convolution
("filter in the Laplacian eigenbasis") both come straight from here. The Laplacian is the graph
analogue of the continuous Laplacian operator, which is why "graph Fourier transform" and
"diffusion on graphs" make sense — tying this card to Fourier analysis (card 12) and geometric deep
learning (card 10). Cheeger's inequality is a classic theory talking point.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Meet the Laplacian** — watch [Spectral Partitioning, Part 1: The Graph Laplacian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVnOANM0oJE). *L = D − A and what its eigenvectors mean — the entry point.*
2. **See spectral clustering** — read [von Luxburg's Tutorial on Spectral Clustering](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/courses/ml14/notes/Luxburg07_tutorial_spectral_clustering.pdf). *The single best explanation of why low Laplacian eigenvectors cluster.*
3. **Get the theory** — work [Spielman's Spectral Graph Theory notes, Lec 1–3](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/561/). *Fundamental graphs, Courant–Fischer, and the Fiedler value, rigorously.*
4. **Reach Cheeger** — study the Cheeger-inequality lectures in those notes. *The eigenvalue ↔ conductance bound that justifies spectral partitioning.*
5. **Connect to GNNs** — watch [Geometric Deep Learning Lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtA0lg_e5nA) and a [GNN lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL5Nc8Axv5A). *The Laplacian eigenbasis is exactly the spectral view of graph convolution.*
