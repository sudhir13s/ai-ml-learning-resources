# VC Dimension
> The Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension measures the *capacity* of a hypothesis class: the size of the
> largest set of points the class can shatter (label in all 2ⁿ possible ways). A finite VC dimension
> is exactly what makes a class PAC-learnable, and it converts an infinite hypothesis space into a
> finite "effective" complexity via the growth function and Sauer's lemma.

**Why it matters:** VC dimension is the cleanest answer to "how complex is my model class, really?"
It explains why a linear classifier in d dimensions needs ~d samples, gives the classic
`O(√(VC/n))` generalization bound, and is the canonical interview lead-in ("what does it mean to
shatter a set? what's the VC dimension of intervals / half-spaces?"). It's the bridge from PAC
(card 5) to data-dependent bounds via Rademacher complexity (card 7).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Define shattering** — watch [Caltech Lecture 7: The VC Dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc0sr0kdBVI). *Shattering and the VC dimension, with the half-space example everyone gets asked.*
2. **See where it comes from** — watch [Lecture 5: Training vs Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEYAnnLazMU) and [Lecture 6: Theory of Generalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FWRijsmLtE). *The growth function and Sauer's lemma that VC dimension controls.*
3. **Read it rigorously** — work [Understanding Machine Learning, Ch. 6 (VC dimension)](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf). *Sauer–Shelah lemma and the fundamental theorem of PAC learning.*
4. **Prove the bound** — derive the VC generalization bound and Sauer's lemma from those chapters. *The polynomial-bound-from-finite-VC argument is the technical core.*
5. **Push to data-dependent capacity** — see why VC can be loose for deep nets, then move to [Rademacher complexity](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/specialized-studies/advanced-mathematics-for-ai-research/rademacher-complexity-and-generalization-bounds/rademacher-complexity-and-generalization-bounds). *VC is worst-case; Rademacher is the tighter, distribution-aware successor.*
