# Statistical Learning Theory — PAC Learning
> The theory of *when learning is possible*: the PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) framework asks
> how many samples guarantee, with probability ≥ 1−δ, that a learner's error is ≤ ε. It formalizes
> the bias–variance / approximation–estimation split, empirical risk minimization (ERM), uniform
> convergence, and the sample complexity of a hypothesis class.

**Why it matters:** this is the rigorous answer to "why does more data help, and how much do I need?"
It turns "the model seems to generalize" into a probabilistic guarantee with ε and δ. ERM,
uniform convergence, the no-free-lunch theorem, and the realizable-vs-agnostic distinction are
classic theory-interview material — and the launchpad for VC dimension (card 6) and Rademacher
complexity (card 7).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Frame the learning problem** — watch [Caltech "Learning From Data", Lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbyG85GZ0PI). *Sets up in-sample vs out-of-sample error — the whole motivation for the theory.*
2. **See why generalization is even possible** — watch [Lecture 5: Training vs Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEYAnnLazMU). *The dichotomy/growth-function idea that replaces "infinite hypotheses = no guarantees".*
3. **Read the framework** — work [Understanding Machine Learning, Ch. 2–4 (PAC, ERM, uniform convergence)](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf). *The definitive modern treatment of PAC.*
4. **Do the proof** — derive the finite-hypothesis-class bound (Hoeffding + union bound) from those chapters. *This one-page proof is the heart of the whole subject.*
5. **Generalize** — move to agnostic PAC and the no-free-lunch theorem (UML Ch. 5), then on to [VC dimension](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/specialized-studies/advanced-mathematics-for-ai-research/vc-dimension/vc-dimension). *Where "which classes are learnable?" gets its real answer.*
