# Memory Systems — Hippocampus · Replay · Consolidation
> How the brain forms, stores, and stabilizes memories. The **hippocampus** rapidly binds experiences
> (place cells, grid cells form a cognitive map), then during rest and sleep it **replays** compressed
> spike sequences in **sharp-wave ripples**, gradually consolidating memories into neocortex. This is
> the brain's experience replay — and yes, it directly inspired replay buffers in deep RL.

**Why it matters:** the parallels to ML are vivid and exam-worthy: hippocampal replay ↔ experience
replay in DQN; systems consolidation ↔ avoiding catastrophic forgetting; complementary learning
systems (fast hippocampus + slow cortex) ↔ the fast/slow weight ideas in continual learning. It's the
clearest case where a memory mechanism crossed from neuroscience into a working ML algorithm.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the building blocks** — watch [Building Blocks of Memory in the Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5trRLX7PQY). *Engrams, place cells, and how a memory is physically stored.*
2. **See replay & consolidation** — watch [Memory Consolidation: Time Machine of the Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NteHQv0ceN4). *Replay during sleep moving memories hippocampus → cortex.*
3. **Read the cognitive map** — [Place Cells, Grid Cells, and Memory](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4315928/). *The spatial code (O'Keefe / Mosers, 2014 Nobel), open access.*
4. **Read the replay mechanism** — [The hippocampal sharp wave-ripple in memory retrieval & consolidation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6794196/). *How ripples select and replay experiences.*
5. **Connect to ML** — link replay to [experience replay](../../../core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/README.md) and continual learning. *Same idea: replay past experience to learn stably.*
