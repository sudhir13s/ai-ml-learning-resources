# Biologically-Plausible Backprop Alternatives
> Backprop works spectacularly — but the brain almost certainly doesn't do it. It requires a precise
> backward pass that reuses the forward weights (the **weight-transport problem**), global error
> signals, and separate forward/backward phases — none of which biology obviously supports. This card
> surveys the candidates: **feedback alignment, target propagation, predictive coding, equilibrium
> propagation, and the forward-forward algorithm**.

**Why it matters:** this is the intellectual heart of neuro-AI and a top-tier interview topic. You
should be able to state *exactly why* backprop is biologically implausible (weight transport, non-local
credit assignment, two distinct phases), and name how each alternative attacks one of those problems —
e.g. feedback alignment kills weight transport with random feedback, predictive coding makes credit
assignment local, forward-forward removes the backward pass entirely.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Frame the problem** — read [Backpropagation and the brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-020-0277-3) (Lillicrap, Hinton et al.). *The definitive statement of why backprop is implausible and what could replace it.*
2. **Feedback alignment** — [Random synaptic feedback weights support error backpropagation](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13276). *Random feedback weights still let learning work — no weight transport needed.*
3. **Predictive coding route** — watch [Predictive Coding Approximates Backprop (paper explained)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB4B5FYvtdI). *Local error units recover the backprop gradient.*
4. **Forward-Forward** — watch [This Algorithm Could Make a GPT-4 Toaster Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVzDRfO2sgs), then read [The Forward-Forward Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345). *Two forward passes, no backward pass at all (Hinton, 2022).*
5. **See the local-learning contrast** — review [04 Hebbian Learning & STDP](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/specialized-studies/neuroscience-and-brain-inspired-ai/hebbian-learning-and-stdp/hebbian-learning-and-stdp). *All these methods reach for local, biologically-realizable updates.*
