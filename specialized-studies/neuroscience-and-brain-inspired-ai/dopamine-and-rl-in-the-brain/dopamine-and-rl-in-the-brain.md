# Dopamine & Reinforcement Learning in the Brain
> The most celebrated bridge between neuroscience and AI: **dopamine neurons signal the
> reward-prediction error** — the exact `δ = r + γV(s') − V(s)` quantity at the heart of
> temporal-difference learning. Schultz's recordings showed dopamine firing shifts from reward to the
> earliest predictor of reward, precisely as a TD learner's error signal does. RL's biological vindication.

**Why it matters:** this is the textbook example of theory predicting biology — Sutton & Barto's TD
error was derived from algorithms, then *found* in the brain. The interview-relevant story is exact:
phasic dopamine ≈ TD error, the striatum ≈ the critic, and recent work (distributional dopamine)
shows the brain may even encode a *distribution* of returns, mirroring distributional RL.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Anchor the algorithm** — review [6.01 Bellman Optimality & Q-Learning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/decision-making-and-control/value-learning/bellman-equation-and-q-learning-intuition). *You must know the TD error before seeing it in the brain.*
2. **Read the bridge** — [Dopamine and temporal difference learning (DeepMind blog)](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/dopamine-and-temporal-difference-learning-a-fruitful-relationship-between-neuroscience-and-ai/). *The clearest telling of the dopamine = TD-error story.*
3. **Read the synthesis** — [Understanding dopamine and reinforcement learning](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3176615/) (Niv & Montague). *The reward-prediction-error hypothesis, open access.*
4. **Go to the source review** — [Dopamine reward prediction error coding](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4826767/) (Schultz). *The experimental evidence from the discoverer.*
5. **See the frontier** — [A distributional code for value in dopamine-based RL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1924-6). *The brain may encode a full return distribution, à la distributional RL.*
