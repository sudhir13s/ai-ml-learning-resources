# Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
> Networks of model neurons that communicate with discrete **spikes** in continuous time, not smooth
> activations every layer-step. They are the "third generation" of neural nets — event-driven, sparse,
> and the natural software for neuromorphic hardware — but the spike's non-differentiability makes
> training the central challenge, solved today with **surrogate gradients**.

**Why it matters:** SNNs are where biology and deep learning collide on the engineering bench. The
interview-relevant ideas are concrete: why spikes break backprop (zero/undefined gradient at the
threshold), how surrogate gradients fix it, and why event-driven sparsity promises orders-of-magnitude
energy savings — the efficiency argument that ties this card to quantization and neuromorphic chips.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See why spikes matter** — watch [The Core Equation Of Neuroscience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOmhHE2xctw). *The LIF/HH dynamics each SNN unit runs.*
2. **Encode inputs as spikes** — [snnTorch — Spike Encoding](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_1.html). *Rate/latency encoding is step one of any SNN.*
3. **Train one end-to-end** — [snnTorch — Training SNNs with backprop](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_5.html). *Surrogate gradients in practice — the key trick.*
4. **Read the bridge paper** — [Training SNNs Using Lessons From Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12894). *The definitive tutorial-paper connecting DL and SNNs.*
5. **Understand the gradient trick** — [Surrogate Gradient Learning in SNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09948). *Why and how you replace the spike's derivative.*
