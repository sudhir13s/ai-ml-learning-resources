# Neural Coding — Rate · Temporal · Population
> How does a spike train *mean* something? Neural coding is the study of the mapping from stimulus to
> spikes (encoding) and from spikes back to stimulus (decoding) — via **rate codes** (how many spikes),
> **temporal codes** (when each spike lands), and **population codes** (the pattern across many cells).
> This is information theory applied to the brain.

**Why it matters:** it's the most *transferable* neuroscience math for an ML person — tuning curves
are receptive fields, population codes are distributed representations, and the rate-vs-temporal
debate is exactly the question SNNs and neuromorphic encoders must answer. The Bayesian-brain /
efficient-coding view also rhymes directly with information bottleneck and entropy.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Frame the question** — read [Scholarpedia: Spike-timing dependent plasticity](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity) intro for the spike-timing-matters case, then skim a tuning-curve overview. *Why timing and population pattern carry information beyond a mean rate.*
2. **Get the formal coding math** — [Theoretical Neuroscience Ch. 1–3](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/book/) (Dayan & Abbott). *Encoding/decoding, spike-triggered averages, Fisher information — the rigorous core.*
3. **Connect to information theory** — relate it to [entropy / mutual information](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/foundational-mental-models/information-and-dependence/entropy-and-kl-divergence-intuition). *Efficient coding = maximize information per spike given a metabolic budget.*
4. **See it in spiking nets** — read [snnTorch — Spike Encoding tutorial](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_1.html). *Rate, latency, and delta encoders implemented in code.*
5. **Go deeper on population codes** — [Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/) coding notebooks. *Decode a stimulus from a population of tuning curves yourself.*
