# Connectomics
> Mapping the brain's complete wiring diagram — the **connectome** — neuron by neuron, synapse by
> synapse. From the 302-neuron worm (*C. elegans*, the first complete connectome) to the 2024
> 140,000-neuron adult fruit-fly brain, connectomics reconstructs neural circuits from electron
> microscopy using large-scale ML for image segmentation and synapse detection.

**Why it matters:** connectomics is both a data-engineering / computer-vision triumph (petabyte EM
volumes segmented by deep nets) and the structural ground truth for everything else in this section.
The interview-relevant angles: (1) it's a massive ML application — 3D segmentation at scale; (2) the
graph it produces is what brain-inspired architectures abstract; (3) "wiring ≠ function" is the
honest caveat — a static map doesn't give you the dynamics.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the vision** — watch [I am my connectome (TED)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L74TEED6fzw). *Why a wiring diagram might matter — Sebastian Seung's case.*
2. **Go deeper** — watch [Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS6nTA3DUuY). *The science and the ML behind reconstructing circuits.*
3. **See the first connectome** — [White et al. 1986 — C. elegans connectome (OpenWorm)](http://openworm.org/ConnectomeToolbox/White_1986/). *The 302-neuron worm: where connectomics began.*
4. **See the frontier** — [Neuronal wiring diagram of an adult brain (FlyWire, 2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07558-y). *The full fruit-fly connectome — 140k neurons, 50M synapses.*
5. **Explore the data** — browse [FlyWire](https://flywire.ai/) or [MICrONS Explorer](https://www.microns-explorer.org/). *Interact with real reconstructed circuits.*
