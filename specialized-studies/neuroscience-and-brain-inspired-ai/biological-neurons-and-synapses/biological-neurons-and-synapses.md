# Biological Neurons & Synapses
> The real computing element the artificial neuron is a cartoon of: a membrane that integrates
> incoming current, fires an all-or-none **spike** when its voltage crosses threshold, and talks to
> other neurons across chemical **synapses**. Understand the Hodgkin–Huxley and leaky
> integrate-and-fire models and you understand why a biological neuron is *not* a weighted sum.

**Why it matters:** this is the ground truth every brain-inspired idea (SNNs, STDP, neuromorphic
hardware) builds on. The interview-relevant payoff is the contrast: a `y = σ(Wx + b)` unit is a
rate-coded, stateless caricature of a leaky, threshold, spiking dynamical system — knowing exactly
where the analogy holds and breaks is the whole point of this domain.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the picture** — watch [The Action Potential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6rvUJlg7o). *A correct mental model of spike generation before any equations.*
2. **Get the core equation** — watch [The Core Equation Of Neuroscience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOmhHE2xctw). *Hodgkin–Huxley made visual — ion channels, gating, voltage.*
3. **Read the model math** — [Neuronal Dynamics Ch. 1 (Integrate-and-Fire)](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.html) then [Ch. 2 (Hodgkin–Huxley)](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.html). *The LIF and HH equations you can actually simulate.*
4. **See dendrites compute** — watch [Your Brain Is 150,000 Mini-Brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dykkubb-Qus). *Why a single neuron is closer to a small network than a single unit.*
5. **Simulate one** — work the [Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/) biological-neuron notebooks. *Implementing LIF cements the "leaky ReLU with state" intuition.*
