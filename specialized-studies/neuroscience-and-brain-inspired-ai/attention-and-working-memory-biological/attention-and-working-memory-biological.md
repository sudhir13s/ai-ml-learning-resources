# Attention & Working Memory (biological)
> Two intertwined cognitive controllers. **Selective attention** is the brain biasing competition
> between stimuli — boosting the gain of behaviorally relevant signals (the biased-competition model).
> **Working memory** is holding information "online" for seconds, classically via **persistent
> neural activity** in prefrontal cortex (and, recent work argues, partly via activity-silent synaptic traces).

**Why it matters:** the name "attention" in transformers is a *loose* analogy to biological attention,
and knowing exactly how loose is a sharp interview signal. Biological attention is gain modulation and
competition, not a softmax over key-query dot products — and biological working memory is recurrent
persistent activity, not a fixed context window. Articulating where the metaphor helps and misleads is
the whole value of this card.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get working memory** — watch [The Neurobiology of Working Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lzbEb-7_NI). *Persistent prefrontal activity as the substrate of "holding in mind."*
2. **Read the mechanism** — [Role of Prefrontal Persistent Activity in Working Memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4700146/). *The classic delay-period firing account, open access.*
3. **Get selective attention** — [Neuronal Mechanisms of Visual Attention](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8279254/). *Biased competition and gain modulation in cortex.*
4. **Contrast with ML attention** — review [4.08 Multi-Head Attention Routing](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/architectural-mechanisms/attention-and-routing/multi-head-attention-intuition.md). *See precisely how the transformer mechanism differs from biological attention.*
5. **See the memory-attention link** — watch [A Brain-Inspired Algorithm For Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WPJdAW-sFo). *Modern Hopfield networks tie associative memory to attention math.*
