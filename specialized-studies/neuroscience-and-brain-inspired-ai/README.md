# 🧠 Neuroscience & Brain-Inspired AI — Curriculum (Specialization)
> Elective deep-dive track, absorbed and expanded from the retired `math-for-AIML-Q5`
> neuroscience specialization. Format: what to study → why → best resources → connections
> back to [ai-ml-intuitions](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/).

**Goal:** the mathematics of biological computation — neuron dynamics, plasticity, neural
coding — and the two-way street between neuroscience and modern AI (what the brain inspired,
and where the analogies break).

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) with its resource card — a short
guided learning path plus the best **free, open** courses, videos, papers, articles, and books for that
topic.

## Study order & what each module unlocks

| Module | Key sub-topics | Best resources | Connections |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **N1. Dynamical-systems foundations** | neural state variables, linear stability, attractors, noise | Neuromatch W2D2; Strogatz *Nonlinear Dynamics* ch. 1–6 | the continuous-time view behind [6.04's MDP loop](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/decision-making-and-control/mdps-and-environments/mdps-and-exploration-intuition.md) |
| **N2. Single-neuron models** | leaky integrate-and-fire, Hodgkin-Huxley intuition, firing rates vs spikes | Gerstner ch. 1–2, 4; Neuromatch W2D3 | the *real* neuron vs the [4.14 artificial one](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/architectural-mechanisms/nonlinear-transformation/activation-functions-and-softmax-intuition.md) (a LIF neuron ≈ leaky ReLU with state) |
| **N3. Synapses & plasticity** | Hebbian learning ("fire together, wire together"), STDP, homeostasis | Gerstner ch. 19; Kirsanov's STDP video | contrast with [backprop](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/learning-and-optimization/gradients-and-credit-assignment/chain-rule-and-backpropagation-intuition.md): local vs global credit assignment — the field's deepest open analogy gap |

| **N5. Recurrent circuits & memory** | attractor networks, Hopfield nets, working memory | Gerstner ch. 17; [Hopfield is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217) | [4.07 gating/LSTM](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/architectural-mechanisms/memory-and-gating/lstm-and-gru-gates-intuition.md); modern Hopfield ↔ [attention](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/architectural-mechanisms/attention-and-routing/multi-head-attention-intuition.md) |
| **N6. Decision & reward** | evidence accumulation (drift-diffusion), **dopamine = TD error**, predictive coding | Neuromatch W3D2; Schultz's reward-prediction papers | the famous bridge: dopamine neurons compute the [Bellman/TD error](../../../ai-ml-intuitions/decision-making-and-control/value-learning/bellman-equation-and-q-learning-intuition.md) — RL's biological vindication |
| **N7.

| **N8. Brain ↔ modern AI** | local learning vs backprop, energy/predictive-coding views, memory & attention parallels | [Backprop and the brain (Hinton/Lillicrap)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-020-0277-3); Kirsanov | the honest scorecard: where the analogy works (RL, attention-ish) and where it doesn't (backprop, scale) |

### Suggested first pass
1. N1 → N2 (the dynamics language), then N4 (coding — the most transferable math).
2. N6 is the highest-ROI module for an ML person: TD-learning-in-the-brain makes Module 6
   click at a deeper level.
3. N3 + N8 as a pair: the credit-assignment contrast is the intellectually richest thread.

**Completion target:** simulate a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, explain STDP vs backprop
credit assignment, and tell the dopamine-as-TD-error story accurately.
