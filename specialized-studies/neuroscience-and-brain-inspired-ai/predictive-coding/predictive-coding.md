# Predictive Coding
> A theory of cortex as a **prediction machine**: higher layers send top-down predictions of what
> lower layers should be seeing, lower layers send back only the **prediction error** (the surprise).
> The brain learns by minimizing that error everywhere, locally — a strikingly backprop-like
> objective achieved without a global backward pass.

**Why it matters:** predictive coding is the most concrete *biologically-plausible alternative to
backprop*. Its punchline — proven mathematically — is that predictive-coding networks can
**approximate the backprop gradient using only local computations**. That makes it the bridge between
the brain's local learning and deep learning's global credit assignment, and a recurring topic where
neuroscience meaningfully informs ML.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Predictive Coding: Why Our Brain Is Constantly Predicting The Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eSxcygk8UM). *The prediction-error mental model before any math.*
2. **Read the founding paper** — [Rao & Ballard (1999): Predictive coding in the visual cortex](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dana/nn.pdf). *Where the theory began; explains extra-classical receptive fields.*
3. **See the backprop link** — watch [Predictive Coding Approximates Backprop (paper explained)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB4B5FYvtdI). *The headline result, walked through.*
4. **Read that result** — [Predictive Coding Approximates Backprop along Arbitrary Computation Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04182). *Local error units recover the global gradient.*
5. **Get the full review** — [Predictive Coding: a Theoretical and Experimental Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12979). *Mechanisms, variants, and open questions in one place.*
