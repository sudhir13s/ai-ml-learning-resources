# Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
> Systems that read neural activity (and sometimes write to it) to control external devices — a cursor,
> a robotic arm, synthesized speech. The hard part is the **decoder**: a machine-learning model that
> maps noisy, high-dimensional, non-stationary neural signals to intended action. BCIs are applied
> neural coding plus real-time ML, from intracortical arrays (BrainGate, Neuralink) to non-invasive EEG.

**Why it matters:** BCIs are where neural coding meets practical machine learning under brutal
constraints — few labeled samples, drifting signals, real-time latency. The decoder is a
classification/regression problem on population activity, so the interview-relevant skills are exactly
ML ones (feature extraction, Kalman filters, RNN/transformer decoders) applied to a coding substrate
covered earlier in this section.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See what's possible** — watch [How brain-computer connections could end paralysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTsItgKHvA). *Stanford/BrainGate work restoring movement and communication.*
2. **See the current state** — watch [Neuralink brain chip's first human patient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmqSYgM8QHc). *How a modern intracortical BCI works, end to end.*
3. **Read the engineering** — [Human intracortical recording and neural decoding for BCIs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5815832/). *The decoder pipeline and its ML challenges, open access.*
4. **Ground it in coding** — review [02 Neural Coding](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/specialized-studies/neuroscience-and-brain-inspired-ai/neural-coding/neural-coding). *Decoding is just neural coding's inverse problem.*
5. **Connect the ML** — the decoder is a sequence model; relate to [05. Deep Learning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/readme) RNN/transformer decoders.
