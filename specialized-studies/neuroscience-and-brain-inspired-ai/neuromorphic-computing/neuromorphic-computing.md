# Neuromorphic Computing
> Hardware that computes the way the brain does: **event-driven, massively parallel, in-memory**, with
> spiking neurons and synapses on-chip instead of a von-Neumann CPU shuttling data to and from RAM.
> Think Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth, SpiNNaker — chips where computation happens only when a spike
> arrives, slashing energy for sparse, temporal workloads.

**Why it matters:** this is the *why now* of the whole brain-inspired program — the energy wall.
A GPU burns power on every dense matmul; a neuromorphic chip spends energy only on spikes that fire.
The interview-relevant framing is the same efficiency argument behind quantization and sparsity,
pushed all the way down to the silicon: co-design the algorithm (SNNs) and the substrate.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the vision** — watch [How neuromorphic computing will change our world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9C3kJE7G-Q). *The energy/sparsity case from Intel's neuromorphic lead.*
2. **See real silicon** — watch [Neuromorphic Computing on Intel's Loihi 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxXTiHExBNc). *How SNNs map onto an actual neuromorphic chip.*
3. **Read the landscape** — [Opportunities for neuromorphic computing algorithms and applications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-020-00475-8). *The definitive open survey of where the field is and is going.*
4. **Connect to SNNs** — review [03 Spiking Neural Networks](../spiking-neural-networks/spiking-neural-networks.md). *Neuromorphic hardware exists to run SNNs efficiently.*
5. **Tie it to ML efficiency** — relate to [quantization](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/scaling-adaptation-and-efficiency/compression/quantization-intuition.md). *Both chase energy-per-inference; neuromorphic does it via events, quantization via bits.*
