# The Free Energy Principle / Active Inference
> Karl Friston's grand unifying theory: any self-organizing system that resists disorder must minimize
> **variational free energy** — an upper bound on surprise, the same quantity as the negative ELBO in
> machine learning. **Active inference** extends this to action: you don't just update beliefs to match
> the world, you also *act* to make the world match your predictions.

**Why it matters:** the free energy principle is where neuroscience and ML share the *exact same math*
— variational free energy **is** the negative evidence lower bound (ELBO) used to train VAEs.
Predictive coding falls out as a special case. The interview-relevant insight is that perception
(belief updating) and action (active inference) become one optimization, and it directly mirrors the
variational objectives you already know from generative modeling.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Hear it from the source** — watch [Free Energy Principle — Karl Friston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIu_dJGyIQI). *Markov blankets, model evidence, and the core claim.*
2. **Get a careful intro** — watch [The Free Energy Principle and predictive processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkH-7gZnrr4). *The clearest plain-language unpacking of free energy = surprise bound.*
3. **Read the unified-theory paper** — [The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787). *Friston's accessible Nature review (open).*
4. **Connect to the ELBO** — recognize free energy as the negative ELBO from variational inference. *The single most useful equivalence for an ML reader.*
5. **Get the math** — [The free energy principle for action and perception: a mathematical review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09156). *Buckley et al.'s rigorous, readable derivation.*
