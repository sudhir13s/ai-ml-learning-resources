# Hebbian Learning & STDP
> "Cells that fire together, wire together." Hebbian learning is the brain's **local, unsupervised**
> plasticity rule: strengthen a synapse when pre- and post-synaptic activity coincide.
> **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)** is its precise, experimentally-measured form — the
> *order* and *millisecond gap* between pre- and post-spikes decides potentiation vs. depression.

**Why it matters:** this is the field's deepest contrast with deep learning. Hebbian/STDP is **local**
(each synapse uses only its own pre/post signals) and needs no global error signal — the opposite of
backprop's non-local credit assignment. Articulating that gap — local correlation-based plasticity vs.
the chain rule — is the single most important idea connecting neuroscience to ML learning theory.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the principle** — read [Wikipedia: Hebbian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory) for "fire together, wire together" and its instability (why you need normalization). *The one-line rule and its catch.*
2. **Get STDP precisely** — [Scholarpedia: Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity). *The asymmetric LTP/LTD timing window, authoritative and free.*
3. **Read the modern review** — [The spike timing dependence of plasticity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3431193/) (Feldman, 2012). *Experimental evidence and what STDP does and doesn't explain.*
4. **See the credit-assignment contrast** — compare with [backprop](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/learning-and-optimization/gradients-and-credit-assignment/chain-rule-and-backpropagation-intuition.md). *Local correlation vs. global gradient — the field's open analogy gap.*
5. **Get the math** — [Neuronal Dynamics Ch. 19 (Synaptic Plasticity & Learning)](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch19.html). *Hebbian/STDP as differential equations you can simulate.*
