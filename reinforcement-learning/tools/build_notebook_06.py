"""Generate the step-by-step teaching notebook (06-Q-Learning.ipynb).

The notebook mirrors ``q_learning.py`` one step at a time so a learner can open it, run every cell live, and
*see* Q-learning built and proven on real environments: the Q-table, ε-greedy behaviour, the TD update done by
hand, the training loop, the greedy-policy evaluation, the value-iteration ground truth it is checked against,
the learned policy/value heatmap, the ε schedule and Q(start) convergence, the honest stochastic case, and the
Sutton & Barto Example 6.6 Q-learning-vs-SARSA cliff contrast. Each numbered step has a short markdown lead-in
(the intuition) followed by a focused code cell with real output.

    python build_notebook_06.py         # writes the .ipynb (unexecuted) into the chapter's code/
    python -m nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
        "../06-Q-Learning/code/06-Q-Learning.ipynb"

This generator lives in the domain-level ``08. Reinforcement_Learning/tools/`` folder; the notebook it writes
(and the module it mirrors) stay in the chapter's ``code/`` folder. Kept as a generator (not a hand-edited
.ipynb) so the notebook and the module stay in lockstep.
