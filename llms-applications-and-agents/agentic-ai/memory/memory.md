# Memory for Agents (short- & long-term)
> **Short-term memory** is the context window (recent turns, scratchpad). **Long-term memory** lives
> *outside* the model — usually a vector store you retrieve from — so the agent recalls facts,
> preferences, and past episodes across sessions. Memory is what turns a stateless chat into a
> persistent agent.

**Why it matters:** the practical answer to "how does an agent remember beyond the context window?"
Interviews want the short-vs-long-term split, how long-term memory is *retrieval* (embeddings + vector
DB — the bridge to RAG), the types (episodic / semantic / procedural), and the hard parts: what to
write, when to summarize/compact, and how to avoid stale or contradictory memories.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Frame the components** — read the **memory** section of ⭐ [Lilian Weng: LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/). *Maps agent memory onto human memory types — the standard framing.*
2. **Make it concrete** — read [Memory in Agents](https://www.philschmid.de/memory-in-agents). *Clear, code-level treatment of short- vs long-term memory.*
3. **See production patterns** — read [Memory for Agents](https://www.langchain.com/blog/memory-for-agents). *Semantic/episodic/procedural memory and when to use each.*
4. **Watch a build** — watch [LangGraph Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqS1kib7RTw). *Persistent state and memory wired into an agent.*
5. **Study a memory-driven agent** — read [Generative Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442). *A memory stream + retrieval + reflection that produces believable long-horizon behavior.*
