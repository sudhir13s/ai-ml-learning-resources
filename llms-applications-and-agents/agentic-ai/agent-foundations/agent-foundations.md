# LLM Agents — Overview & the Agent Loop
> An *agent* wraps an LLM in a loop: it observes a goal, **decides** what to do, **acts** via tools,
> **observes** the result, and repeats until done. The mental model is **`Agent = LLM + planning +
> memory + tool use`** — the LLM is the controller, not the whole system.

**Why it matters:** the framing question for the entire field — "what makes something an *agent* vs a
plain prompt or a fixed workflow?" Interviewers want the agent loop (think → act → observe), the
difference between **workflows** (predefined paths) and **agents** (the model drives control flow),
and *when not* to build an agent (cost, latency, reliability) — the single most common senior-level
trap in this area.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the canonical mental model** — read ⭐ [Lilian Weng: LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/). *The reference survey: it defines the planning + memory + tool-use decomposition everyone else builds on.*
2. **Learn the engineering judgment** — read [Anthropic: Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). *Workflows vs agents and when each is the right tool — the part interviews probe.*
3. **See it framed visually** — watch [How We Build Effective Agents (Barry Zhang)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7_ipDqhtwk). *The same ideas from the people who wrote the guide, with concrete patterns.*
4. **Ground it historically** — skim [AIMA Ch. 2 "Intelligent Agents"](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/). *Agents, environments, and rationality predate LLMs; this is where the vocabulary comes from.*
5. **Build one** — do the [Hugging Face Agents Course, Unit 1](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/introduction). *Implementing a think-act-observe loop makes the abstraction concrete.*
