# Tool Use & Function Calling — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Tool Use & Function Calling](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/agentic-ai/tool-use/tool-use)** (the
> concept page). Kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type,
> best-first. Everything here is **free / open** — no paywall. Every source cited under a
> "Source / derivation" line on the concept page appears here, so each claim is traceable to a primary
> source. Chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See the contract** — read ⭐ [OpenAI: Function Calling guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) (**OpenAI**). *The clearest spec of tool schemas and the request/response round-trip — the pattern this chapter mirrors.*
2. **Compare a second implementation** — read [Anthropic: Tool Use overview](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview) (**Anthropic**). *Two vendors converging on `tool_use`/`tool_result` reveals what's essential vs incidental.*
3. **See it on an open model** — read [Qwen: Function Calling / Hermes-style tool template](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/framework/function_call.html) (**Qwen team**). *Exactly the `<tool_call>` chat-template convention the runnable code on this page uses.*
4. **Understand where the ability comes from** — read [Toolformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) (**Schick et al., 2023**). *Tool use as a learned competence, not a prompt trick.*
5. **See how "correct call" is measured** — open the [Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html) (**Patil et al.**). *The large-scale version of this chapter's structured-vs-text reliability test.*

**📄 Key papers**:
- [Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) — **Schick et al. (2023)**. — the source for "the model natively knows how to call tools": a model fine-tuned to insert API calls into its own generations, self-supervised by whether a call reduced its loss. *(The concept page's first "Source / derivation" traces here.)*
- [Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15334) — **Patil et al. (2023)**. — trains + evaluates LLMs on producing *correct, executable* API calls and introduces the AST-matching evaluation behind the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard — the formal version of this chapter's "did we get a dispatchable call?" axis. *(The concept page's second "Source / derivation" traces here.)*
- [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) — **Yao et al. (2022), ICLR 2023**. — the text-protocol contrast: tool calls as free-text actions inside a reasoning loop. Read it to see exactly what structured function calling *replaces* (prose parsing) and *keeps* (the reason→act→observe loop).
- [HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580) — **Shen et al. (2023)**. — an LLM orchestrating many specialised tools/models via structured calls; a vivid picture of where reliable tool calling leads.

**📚 Books (free chapters / full PDFs)**:
- [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach — Ch. 2 "Intelligent Agents"](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) — **Russell & Norvig** — actuators/effectors: tools are the LLM agent's way of acting on the environment; the classical grounding for "an agent acts through a defined interface."
- [Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) — **Jurafsky & Martin** — free draft; the LLM-prompting and tool-use context function calling sits in, from an academic NLP viewpoint.
