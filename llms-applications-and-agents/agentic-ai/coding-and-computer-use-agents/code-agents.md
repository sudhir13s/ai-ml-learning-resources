# Code Agents
> Agents that **read, write, run, and debug code** in a real repo — locating the right files, editing
> them, running tests, and iterating on failures. They turn an LLM into something that can resolve a
> GitHub issue end-to-end. Measured by benchmarks like **SWE-bench**.

**Why it matters:** the highest-value, most-evaluated agent application (and the one powering coding
assistants). Interviews probe the loop (localize → edit → run tests → reflect → repeat), why
**execution feedback** (test results, stack traces) makes code agents far more reliable than
open-ended tasks, the design of the agent–computer interface (file/edit/shell tools), and why
SWE-bench scores are the field's headline metric.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the task & benchmark** — read ⭐ [SWE-bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770). *Defines the "resolve a real GitHub issue" task that frames the whole area.*
2. **Study a concrete agent** — read [SWE-agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793). *The agent–computer interface (file viewer, editor, shell) that drives strong SWE-bench results.*
3. **See production framing** — read [Raising the bar on SWE-bench Verified](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/swe-bench-sonnet). *What a simple, well-designed scaffold + good tools achieves.*
4. **Watch one run for hours** — watch [Claude SDK: 24-Hour Coding Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGouphNN5hg). *Long-horizon code agents and where they break.*
5. **Build one** — do [Building Code Agents with smolagents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/building-code-agents-with-hugging-face-smolagents). *Agents that write code as their action space.*
