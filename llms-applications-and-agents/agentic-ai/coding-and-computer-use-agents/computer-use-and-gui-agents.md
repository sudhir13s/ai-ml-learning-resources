# Computer-Use & GUI Agents
> Agents that operate a **graphical interface** like a person — looking at a screenshot, then issuing
> mouse/keyboard actions (click, type, scroll) to use websites and desktop apps. The action space is
> pixels and UI elements, not a clean API, which makes perception and grounding the hard part.

**Why it matters:** the frontier of "agents that can do anything a human can on a computer." Be ready
to explain why GUI control is harder than API tool use (visual grounding, brittle layouts, long
horizons, no structured feedback), the screenshot→action loop, why benchmarks like **OSWorld** and
**WebArena** matter, and the outsized safety risk (an agent clicking around with real credentials).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See it work** — read ⭐ [Introducing computer use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use). *The clearest demo of screenshot-in → action-out.*
2. **Understand the interface** — read [Computer use tool docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool). *The actual action space (screenshot, click, type) an agent is given.*
3. **Watch a real run** — watch [Claude — Computer use for automating operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODaHJzOyVCQ). *See the loop and its failure modes.*
4. **Learn the benchmark** — read [OSWorld](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07972). *How GUI agents are measured on real desktop/web tasks.*
5. **Survey the field** — read [GUI Agents with Foundation Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04890). *Perception, grounding, and action-space designs across systems.*
