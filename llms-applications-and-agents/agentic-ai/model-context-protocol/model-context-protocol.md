# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
> An **open standard** for connecting LLM apps to tools and data. Instead of bespoke integrations per
> app, an MCP **client** (the agent host) talks to MCP **servers** that expose **tools**,
> **resources**, and **prompts** over a common protocol — the "USB-C port for AI."

**Why it matters:** MCP is the fast-rising answer to "how do agents integrate with the world without
N×M custom glue?" Be ready to explain the **client/server/host** architecture, the three primitives
(tools / resources / prompts), how it differs from raw function calling (a *standard transport &
discovery layer*, not a replacement for the model deciding what to call), and the security surface
(servers run code; prompt injection via resources).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the why** — read ⭐ [Introducing the Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol). *The motivation and the USB-C-for-AI framing in two minutes.*
2. **See the architecture** — read [MCP — Getting Started / Intro](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). *Client/server/host and the tools/resources/prompts primitives, from the spec.*
3. **Watch the clear explainer** — watch [Model Context Protocol (MCP), clearly explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j_NE6Pjv-E). *Why it matters and how the pieces connect.*
4. **Hear it from the source** — watch [The Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQywdSdi5iA). *Anthropic walking through goals and design.*
5. **Place it vs function calling** — re-read [Tool Use overview](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview). *MCP standardizes *how tools are served*; the model still chooses calls via tool use.*
