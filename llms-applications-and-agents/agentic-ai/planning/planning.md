# Planning — Task Decomposition & Plan-and-Execute
> Break a complex goal into ordered sub-tasks *before* (or alongside) acting. **Plan-and-execute**
> writes the whole plan up front then runs steps; **ReAct-style** planning decides the next step each
> turn. Richer variants — **Tree of Thoughts**, **plan-and-solve** — search over multiple plans.

**Why it matters:** the difference between an agent that flails and one that finishes long-horizon
tasks. Interviews probe the trade-off between **upfront planning** (fewer LLM calls, brittle if the
world changes) and **reactive/step-wise planning** (adapts, but slower and can loop), plus how
decomposition, re-planning on failure, and search-based methods (ToT) fit together.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Anchor on the survey** — read the **planning** section of ⭐ [Lilian Weng: LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/). *Defines task decomposition, sub-goals, and reflection in one place.*
2. **See the upfront-plan paper** — read [Plan-and-Solve Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091). *The simplest "plan, then execute the plan" idea and why it helps.*
3. **Learn search over plans** — read [Tree of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601). *Deliberate search across reasoning paths — the planning-as-search view.*
4. **Watch the design pattern** — watch [Andrew Ng on AI Agentic Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1XFm21I-VQ). *Planning as one of the four agentic patterns, with intuition for when it pays off.*
5. **Build a plan-and-execute agent** — do [AI Agents in LangGraph](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph). *Implement explicit plan → execute → re-plan control flow.*
