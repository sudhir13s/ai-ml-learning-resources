# Multi-Agent Systems & Orchestration
> Instead of one agent doing everything, use **multiple specialized agents** that communicate — an
> orchestrator/planner delegating to workers, debating peers, or a role-based "crew." Orchestration
> is the control layer that routes messages, manages shared state, and decides who acts next.

**Why it matters:** the senior-level "how do you scale beyond a single agent?" question. Be ready to
contrast topologies (**orchestrator–worker**, **hierarchical**, **debate/peer**, **network**),
explain *when multi-agent helps* (parallelism, separation of concerns, specialized tools) vs *when it
just adds cost and failure modes*, and name the trade-offs Anthropic flags in their multi-agent
research system (token cost, coordination overhead, evaluation difficulty).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Decide if you even need it** — read ⭐ [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). *Orchestrator–worker patterns and the "keep it simple" bar before going multi-agent.*
2. **See topologies** — watch [Conceptual Guide: Multi-Agent Architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nZl32FwU-o). *Network, supervisor, hierarchical — the standard orchestration shapes.*
3. **Read a real system** — read [How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system). *Concrete wins and costs of orchestrator + sub-agents at scale.*
4. **Study a framework's take** — read [AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155) (conversational) and [MetaGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00352) (role-based). *Two influential designs for agent collaboration.*
5. **Build one** — do [Multi-AI Agent Systems with crewAI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai). *Role-based crews make orchestration tangible.*
