# LLM App Orchestration — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[LLM App Orchestration](llm-app-orchestration.md)** (the concept
> page). External sources *and* internal cross-links, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone
> list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free/open (no paywall) and chosen for depth on
> *this* topic — composing an LLM app as chains, routing to the right path, and stateful cyclic graphs.
> Every framework/mechanism cited on the concept page (LCEL/Runnables, semantic routing, LangGraph
> `StateGraph`, DSPy) appears here as a primary source.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Compose with chains** — watch [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0dUOtOIrfs) (**James Briggs**). *The pipe `|` model: compose Runnables into a chain with streaming/async for free.*
2. **Read the model** — read [LangChain: LCEL concepts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/lcel/). *Why everything is a Runnable and how composition works.*
3. **Add routing** — watch [RAG From Scratch — Routing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfpIndq7Fi8) (**Lance Martin**), then read [LangChain: How to route](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/routing/). *Logical vs semantic routing to the right path — the cosine-argmax decision.*
4. **Graduate to graphs** — read the [LangGraph overview](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/) + watch [LangGraph Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w5cCXlh7JQ) (**Tech With Tim**). *Stateful branches, loops, and a step budget when a linear chain isn't enough.*
5. **See the frontier** — skim the [DSPy paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03714) (**Khattab et al. 2023**). *Declarative modules a compiler optimizes — orchestration where the prompts tune themselves.*

**Interactive & visual**:
- [LangGraph — Quickstart](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/quickstart) — **LangChain** — build, compile, and invoke a `StateGraph` end to end (the stateful-graph API used on the page), runnable.
- [LangGraph — Workflows & Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/workflows-agents) — **LangChain** — the orchestration patterns (prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestrator-worker) as runnable `StateGraph` code.
- [DSPy — GitHub](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) — **Stanford NLP** — the open-source framework to read and run: signatures, modules, and the compiler/optimizer.

**Courses (free)**:
- [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/) — **DeepLearning.AI × LangChain** — the canonical free course on chains, memory, routing, and agents.
- [LangChain Expression Language Explained](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-expression-language/) — **Pinecone** — a free written course on LCEL composition with runnable examples.

**Articles / blogs (free, no paywall)**:
- [LCEL: LangChain Expression Language (concepts)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/lcel/) — **LangChain** — the authoritative explanation of Runnable composition (`prompt | model | parser`).
- [How to route between sub-chains](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/routing/) — **LangChain** — logical and semantic routing recipes (the routing decision the page's Router implements).
- [LangGraph overview](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/) — **LangChain** — when and how to use a stateful, cyclic graph for orchestration (`StateGraph` / `add_node` / `add_conditional_edges`).
- [Introducing Query Pipelines](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-query-pipelines-025dc2bb0537) — **LlamaIndex** — building advanced RAG DAGs by declaring modules and links. (LlamaIndex now recommends **Workflows** for new pipelines; `QueryPipeline` remains for existing DAGs.)

**Key papers**:
- [DSPy: Compiling Declarative Language Model Calls into Self-Improving Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03714) — **Khattab et al. (2023)** — declarative modules (signatures) a compiler optimizes to a metric; orchestration where the prompts tune themselves rather than being hand-written.
- [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) — **Yao et al. (2022)** — the reason-act loop that underpins the cyclic-graph / agent-loop end of orchestration (the step-budget run loop this chapter builds).
