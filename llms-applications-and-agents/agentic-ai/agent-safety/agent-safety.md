# Safety, Guardrails & Human-in-the-Loop
> Agents *act* in the world, so the failure modes are real: wrong/destructive tool calls, **prompt
> injection** via tool output, runaway loops, and data exfiltration. **Guardrails** constrain what an
> agent can do (allow-lists, validation, sandboxing); **human-in-the-loop (HITL)** inserts approval at
> high-stakes steps.

**Why it matters:** the question every serious agent interview ends on — "how do you make this safe to
deploy?" Be ready to discuss the expanded attack surface (the model chooses tools, so untrusted
inputs can hijack actions — **indirect prompt injection**), defenses (least-privilege tools, output
validation, sandboxed execution, spend/iteration limits), and **HITL** patterns (approve-before-act
checkpoints, interrupts) and their failure mode (rubber-stamping when humans are overloaded).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Internalize "keep it simple & observable"** — read ⭐ [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). *Guardrails, stopping conditions, and human checkpoints as first-class design.*
2. **Learn the controls** — read [What Are AI Guardrails?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-guardrails). *Input/output filters, validation, and policy constraints, neutrally explained.*
3. **Learn HITL** — read [Human-in-the-Loop](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/human-in-the-loop) + [LangGraph HITL](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/). *Concept plus the concrete interrupt/approve mechanism.*
4. **Watch a build** — watch [Building Safe AI Agents with Guardrails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk1aqwNJWT4). *Wiring guardrails around tool-using agents.*
5. **Study a safety framework** — read [TrustAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01586). *Constitution-style constraints across pre-/in-/post-planning.*
