# Reflection & Self-Critique
> Have the agent **review its own output** — critique a draft, spot errors, then revise — often using
> feedback from tools, tests, or a separate "critic" pass. Turns a one-shot answer into an iterative
> *generate → critique → improve* loop, the cheapest reliable quality boost in agentic systems.

**Why it matters:** reflection is one of Andrew Ng's four agentic design patterns and a favorite
follow-up to ReAct. Be ready to explain *self-refine* (model critiques itself) vs *Reflexion*
(verbal feedback stored across attempts), why external signals (unit tests, tool errors) make
reflection far more reliable than pure self-grading, and the cost/latency trade-off of extra passes.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the pattern** — read [How Agents Can Improve LLM Performance](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/). *Frames reflection as a design pattern with concrete gains.*
2. **Read self-critique source** — read ⭐ [Self-Refine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651). *Generate → self-feedback → refine, with no extra training.*
3. **See feedback that sticks** — read [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366). *Stores verbal self-reflections across attempts — "verbal RL."*
4. **Watch the design pattern** — watch [Andrew Ng on AI Agentic Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1XFm21I-VQ). *Why iterating beats one-shot, with the reflection pattern called out.*
5. **Connect to grounding** — skim [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). *Evaluator–optimizer loops and using real environment feedback, not just self-grading.*
