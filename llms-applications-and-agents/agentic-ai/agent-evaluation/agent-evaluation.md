# Agent Evaluation & Benchmarks
> Agents are **stochastic, multi-step, and tool-using**, so "did it get the right answer?" isn't
> enough — you measure **task success** in a real environment, plus efficiency (steps, tokens, cost)
> and trajectory quality. Benchmarks like **AgentBench**, **SWE-bench**, **WebArena**, and **OSWorld**
> standardize this.

**Why it matters:** evaluation is what separates a demo from a product, and Andrew Ng calls eval-driven
development the biggest predictor of agent success. Interviews probe *why agent eval is hard*
(non-determinism, partial credit, multi-step error compounding, environment setup), the difference
between **outcome** and **process/trajectory** metrics, **execution-based** evaluation, and which
benchmark fits which capability (coding → SWE-bench, web → WebArena, OS → OSWorld, broad → AgentBench).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See a broad benchmark** — read ⭐ [AgentBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03688). *Evaluates LLMs as agents across 8 environments — the "what do we even measure" overview.*
2. **Study execution-based eval** — read [SWE-bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770). *Success = tests pass; the gold standard for objective, execution-based scoring.*
3. **Add the web/OS environments** — skim [WebArena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13854) + [OSWorld](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07972). *Realistic, reproducible environments with task-completion checks.*
4. **Get the practitioner mindset** — watch [Learn to Build Effective Agentic AI Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7vqXL4PWEE). *Error analysis and eval-driven development, the core skill.*
5. **Tie it to design** — read [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). *Why you measure with real ground truth at each step.*
