# Agent Frameworks (LangGraph, etc., conceptual)
> Libraries that give you the agent loop, tool wiring, state, and orchestration so you don't rebuild
> it each time. **LangGraph** models agents as a stateful graph (nodes = steps, edges = control flow);
> **AutoGen** and **CrewAI** focus on multi-agent conversation/roles. The concepts transfer across all.

**Why it matters:** interviews care less about API trivia and more about *what frameworks abstract*
and *when not to use one*. Be ready to explain why durable, cyclic, stateful graphs (LangGraph) beat
linear chains for real agents, the difference between a **framework** and a hand-rolled loop, and
Anthropic's caution that the best systems are often simple, composable patterns — frameworks add
value but also indirection.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Know when to reach for one** — read ⭐ [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). *Frameworks vs simple composable code — the judgment interviews probe.*
2. **Get the dominant model** — read [LangGraph overview](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/). *Stateful graph of nodes/edges — the abstraction most frameworks converge toward.*
3. **See the contrast** — watch [LangChain vs LangGraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAF1NjEVHhY). *Chains vs graphs: why agents need cycles and state.*
4. **Watch a build** — watch [LangGraph Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqS1kib7RTw). *Nodes, edges, state, and tools assembled into an agent.*
5. **Compare the field** — skim [AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155) and [CrewAI docs](https://docs.crewai.com/). *Conversation-first vs role-first multi-agent designs.*
