# Quantization — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Quantization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/inference-and-runtime/quantization/quantization)** (the concept page). It holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal cross-links — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first within each group. Every entry is a primary source or a recognized deep explainer, chosen for depth on *this* topic. Every formula cited on the concept page has its source here in **Papers**.

**Start here — suggested path:**
1. **Build the intuition (illustrated)** — read [A Visual Guide to Quantization](https://www.maartengrootendorst.com/blog/quantization/) (**Maarten Grootendorst**). *The single best illustrated walkthrough of LLM quantization, end to end.*
2. **Map the methods** — watch [Quantization Explained: GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF, bitsandbytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K75j8MkwgJ0) (**Trelis Research**). *When to reach for which format.*
3. **Do the math from scratch** — read the affine formulation in [Jacob et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877) §2, then this page's code. *Scale, zero-point, round, clamp.*
4. **Understand the outlier problem** — read [LLM.int8()](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339) (**Dettmers et al.**). *The emergent-outlier diagnosis the whole field is built around.*
5. **Read the 4-bit workhorses** — [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) then [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978). *Hessian error-compensation vs activation-aware salience.*
6. **Connect to fine-tuning** — [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) and this platform's [LoRA / PEFT](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/training-and-adaptation/lora-and-parameter-efficient-fine-tuning/lora-and-parameter-efficient-fine-tuning). *Quantize the base, adapt with LoRA.*
