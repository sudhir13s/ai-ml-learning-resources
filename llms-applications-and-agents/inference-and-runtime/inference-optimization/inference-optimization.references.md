# Inference Optimization & Serving — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Inference Optimization & Serving](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/inference-and-runtime/inference-optimization/inference-optimization)** (the concept page). Curated, free/open sources only — external references *and* internal cross-links — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reading list. Grouped by type, best-first within each group. Every cited formula source from the page (PagedAttention, Orca, speculative decoding, roofline, KV-cache size) appears below as a clickable entry.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See the serving picture** — watch [Inference, Serving, PagedAttention and vLLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TBT4WPkDaw) (**AI Makerspace**). *Why KV-cache memory dominates and how paging + batching fix it.*
2. **Do the bottleneck math** — read [Transformer Inference Arithmetic](https://kipp.ly/transformer-inference-arithmetic/) (**kipply**). *Memory bandwidth vs compute — why decode is bandwidth-bound, the page's core derivation.*
3. **Get the biggest lever** — read [How Continuous Batching Enables 23× Throughput](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/continuous-batching-llm-inference) (**Anyscale**). *Static vs continuous batching, with measured numbers.*
4. **Read the source** — read the [PagedAttention / vLLM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180) (**Kwon et al.**). *KV cache as OS virtual memory; 2–4× throughput.*
5. **Go broad** — read [Large Transformer Model Inference Optimization](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-10-inference-optimization/) (**Lilian Weng**). *Quantization, distillation, sparsity, speculative decoding — the full toolbox.*
