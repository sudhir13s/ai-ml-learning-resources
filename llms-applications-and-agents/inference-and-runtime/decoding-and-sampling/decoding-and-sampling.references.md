# Decoding & Sampling — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Decoding & Sampling](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/inference-and-runtime/decoding-and-sampling/decoding-and-sampling)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic (how to turn a next-token distribution into text), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the overview** — watch [Greedy? Min-p? Beam Search? How LLMs Actually Pick Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-_SZ_itxeA) (**AI Coffee Break with Letitia**). *Greedy, beam, top-k/p, min-p in one clear survey — the cleanest map of the whole space.*
2. **Read with runnable code** — [How to generate text: decoding methods with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate) (**Hugging Face**). *Every method with copy-pasteable examples — the canonical code-first explainer.*
3. **See the failure mode** — read [The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751) (**Holtzman et al. 2019**). *Why likelihood-maximizing decoders degenerate, and the nucleus (top-p) fix — the conceptual heart of the topic.*
4. **Compare the knobs side-by-side** — read [How do temperature, top-k, and top-p sampling differ?](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-sampling) (**Sebastian Raschka**). *A crisp, correct contrast of the three core sampling controls.*
5. **Use it in practice** — [Generation strategies](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/generation_strategies) (**Hugging Face**). *The actual parameters and defaults you'll tune in real systems.*

**Videos**:

- [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) — **Andrej Karpathy** — the generation loop where temperature and sampling are implemented line by line.

**Interactive & visual**:
- [LLM Visualizer (3D)](https://bbycroft.net/llm) — **Brendan Bycroft** — walk a token through a small GPT's full forward pass and *see* the logits the decoder then samples from.
- [Generation strategies playground](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/generation_strategies) — **Hugging Face** — change `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p` and watch the output shift.

**Key papers**:
- [A Contrastive Framework for Neural Text Generation (Contrastive Search)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06417) — **Su, Lan, Wang, Yogatama, Kong & Collier (2022)** — picks tokens that are high-probability *and* representation-space-dissimilar to the context, attacking degeneration at its source.
- [Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) — **Hinton, Vinyals & Dean (2015)** — origin of temperature-scaled softmax ($p_i = \text{softmax}(z_i/T)$), §2; the decoding temperature knob is the same transform.
- [Hierarchical Neural Story Generation (top-k sampling)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04833) — **Fan, Lewis & Dauphin (2018)** — introduces and popularizes top-k truncated sampling for open-ended generation.
- [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (GPT-3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) — **Brown et al. (2020)** — temperature/sampling settings used at scale; the practitioner reference for decoding in production.
- [Google's Neural Machine Translation System (GNMT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144) — **Wu et al. (2016)** — §7 gives the length-normalized beam-search score $\frac{1}{L^\alpha}\sum_t \log p$ that corrects beam's bias toward short sequences.
- [Locally Typical Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00666) — **Meister, Pimentel, Wiher & Cotterell (2022)** — keep tokens whose information content is *typical* (near the distribution's entropy), an information-theoretic alternative to top-p.
- [The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration (Nucleus Sampling)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751) — **Holtzman, Buys, Du, Forbes & Choi (2019)** — introduces top-p (nucleus) sampling and the degeneration analysis; the single most important paper for this topic.
