# RLHF & DPO — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[RLHF & DPO](preference-and-alignment-training.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [RLHF, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPN_XZcJf_s) (**StatQuest**). *The 3-stage pipeline without the heavy math.*
2. **Read the illustrated guide** — [Illustrating RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) (**Hugging Face**). *Reward model + PPO + KL penalty, visually.*
3. **Get the systems view** — read [RLHF and its alternatives](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-training-rlhf-and-its-alternatives) (**Sebastian Raschka**). *RLHF, DPO, and the preference-tuning landscape.*
4. **Read the sources** — [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) then [DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290). *The full RLHF recipe, then the reward-model-free alternative.*
5. **Follow DPO's derivation** — watch [DPO math insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ6k5T5s5lY) (**Ricardo Calix**). *Why DPO and RLHF optimize the same objective.*
