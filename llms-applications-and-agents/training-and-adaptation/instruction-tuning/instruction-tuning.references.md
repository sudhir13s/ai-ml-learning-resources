# Instruction Tuning — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Instruction Tuning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/training-and-adaptation/instruction-tuning/instruction-tuning)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. All links are free / no-paywall.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See where it fits** — watch [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) (**Andrej Karpathy**). *Instruction/SFT data is what turns a base model into something you can ask things of — the whole post-training pipeline in one talk.*
2. **Read the source** — [Finetuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners (FLAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01652) (**Wei et al. 2021**). *The result: multitask instruction tuning → zero-shot generalization to held-out task types.*
3. **Get the scaling story** — [Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models (FLAN-T5)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416) (**Chung et al. 2022**). *More tasks, more diversity, and CoT data — what each buys.*
4. **See the cheap recipe** — [Stanford Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) + [Self-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560). *Bootstrap instruction data from the model itself → an open instruction-follower cheaply.*
5. **Do it hands-on** — [Fine-tuning LLMs with example code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC6Hd1hFvos) (**Shaw Talebi**) + this chapter's [notebook](code/14-Instruction-Tuning.ipynb). *Build and watch the generalization gap yourself.*
