# Knowledge Distillation — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Knowledge Distillation](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/training-and-adaptation/knowledge-distillation/knowledge-distillation)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first within each group. Every entry is free/open and chosen for depth on *this* topic. The papers cited for formulas on the concept page all appear under **Papers** below.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Knowledge Distillation in Neural Networks — Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUCSTKQOzcM) (**CodeEmporium**). *Teacher/student, soft targets, and temperature in plain terms — the cleanest conceptual intro.*
2. **Read the source** — read [Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) (**Hinton, Vinyals & Dean, 2015**). *Soft targets, temperature, and the $T^2$ factor — short and foundational.*
3. **See it in code** — follow the [PyTorch Knowledge Distillation tutorial](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/knowledge_distillation_tutorial.html) (**PyTorch**). *Implement teacher→student distillation end to end yourself.*
4. **Connect to LLMs** — read [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) (**Sanh et al., 2019**). *The canonical compression result: 40% smaller, ~97% of the performance.*
5. **Go to generation** — read [Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07947) (**Kim & Rush, 2016**). *Distilling on teacher generations — the form that powers modern small LLMs.*
