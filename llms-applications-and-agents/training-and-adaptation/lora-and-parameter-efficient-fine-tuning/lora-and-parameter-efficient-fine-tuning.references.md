# LoRA & PEFT — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[LoRA & PEFT](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/training-and-adaptation/lora-and-parameter-efficient-fine-tuning/lora-and-parameter-efficient-fine-tuning)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. All links are free / open-access.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the core idea** — watch [LoRA explained (and a bit about precision & quantization)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t509sv5MT0w) (**DeepFindr**). *Low-rank updates and why they're cheap, clearly.*
2. **Nail the concepts** — watch [Low-rank Adaptation: the Key Concepts behind LoRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA-NhCtrrVE) (**Chris Alexiuk**). *Rank, alpha, and merging in a few minutes.*
3. **Read the source** — the [LoRA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) (**Hu et al. 2021**). *The low-rank hypothesis and the $\Delta W = BA$ formulation, with the init and scaling.*
4. **Understand the memory win** — the [QLoRA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) (**Dettmers et al. 2023**). *NF4 + double quant + paged optimizers → 65B on one GPU.*
5. **Use the library** — [Hugging Face PEFT docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index). *Apply LoRA/QLoRA to a real model end to end, then `merge_and_unload()`.*

**Key papers**:
- [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) — **Hu et al. (2021)** — the founding method: low-rank weight updates $\Delta W = \tfrac{\alpha}{r}BA$ with $B$ zero-init, mergeable at inference.
- [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) — **Dettmers et al. (2023)** — NF4 datatype, double quantization, paged optimizers; 4-bit base + LoRA matches 16-bit full FT and fits 65B on one GPU.
- [Intrinsic Dimensionality Explains the Effectiveness of Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13255) — **Aghajanyan et al. (2020)** — measures that fine-tuning lives in a low-dimensional subspace: the empirical premise LoRA rests on.
