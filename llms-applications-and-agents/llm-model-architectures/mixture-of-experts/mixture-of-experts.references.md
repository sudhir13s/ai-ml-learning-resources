# Mixture-of-Experts — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Mixture-of-Experts](mixture-of-experts.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the intuition** — watch [Mixture of Experts (MoE), Visually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QQlYR1r6pQ) (**Jia-Bin Huang**). *Routers, experts, and sparse activation made visual — the cleanest first picture.*
2. **Read the visual guide** — [A Visual Guide to Mixture of Experts](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-mixture-of-experts) (**Maarten Grootendorst**). *The clearest illustrated walkthrough of routing and load balancing.*
3. **Read the definitive blog** — [Mixture of Experts Explained](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe) (**Hugging Face**). *Routing, the balance loss, training instabilities, fine-tuning, and serving in one place.*
4. **Read the source** — [Switch Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) (**Fedus et al.**). *Top-1 routing, the capacity factor, and scaling to a trillion parameters.*
5. **See the frontier** — [DeepSeekMoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066) (**Dai et al.**). *Fine-grained + shared experts — the current state-of-the-art recipe.*
