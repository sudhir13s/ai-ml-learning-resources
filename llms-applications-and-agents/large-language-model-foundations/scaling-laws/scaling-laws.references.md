# Scaling Laws — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Scaling Laws](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/large-language-model-foundations/scaling-laws/scaling-laws)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author (the paper's own authors) or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the intuition** — watch [Chinchilla Scaling Laws explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYCw8QSNT9w) (**Cloudvala**). *Why "bigger isn't always better" and what compute-optimal means, visually.*
2. **See the field context** — watch [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) (**Andrej Karpathy**). *Where scaling laws sit in the full pretraining pipeline and drive the budget decisions.*
3. **Read the correction** — the [Chinchilla paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) (**Hoffmann et al. 2022**). *The three estimation methods → the ~20 tokens/param rule.*
4. **Read the original** — [Scaling Laws for Neural LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) (**Kaplan et al. 2020**). *The first power-law fits — and the LR-schedule assumption Chinchilla overturned.*
5. **Do the compute math** — read [Transformer Math 101](https://blog.eleuther.ai/transformer-math/) (**EleutherAI**). *The `C ≈ 6ND` arithmetic behind the laws, derived.*
