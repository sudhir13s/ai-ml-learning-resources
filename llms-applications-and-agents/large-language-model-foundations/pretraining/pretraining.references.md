# Pretraining at Scale — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Pretraining at Scale](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/large-language-model-foundations/pretraining/pretraining)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic (the systems of pretraining), not popularity. Everything here is free / open-access.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See a real run end to end** — watch [Let's reproduce GPT-2 (124M)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU) (**Andrej Karpathy**). *An actual pretraining run: data, init, warmup+cosine, grad clip, throughput — the whole stack in motion.*
2. **Do the cost math** — read [Transformer Math 101](https://blog.eleuther.ai/transformer-math/) (**EleutherAI**). *Memory, the 6ND compute rule, and the optimizer-state tax you budget every run from.*
3. **Understand the parallelism** — read [How to Train Really Large Models on Many GPUs](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-09-25-train-large/) (**Lilian Weng**). *Data / tensor / pipeline parallelism and ZeRO, explained cleanly.*
4. **Read a full open recipe** — skim the [Llama 2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288) (**Touvron et al.**). *A concretely documented pretraining recipe: data, hyperparameters, tokens-per-parameter.*
5. **See the data pipeline in detail** — read the [FineWeb blog](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1) (**Hugging Face**). *How 15T clean tokens are actually produced from Common Crawl — dedup, filtering, decontamination.*
