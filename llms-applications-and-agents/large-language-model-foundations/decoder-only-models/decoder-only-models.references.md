# Decoder-only Architecture — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Decoder-only Architecture](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/large-language-model-foundations/decoder-only-models/decoder-only-models)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See the architecture** — watch [Transformers, the tech behind LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M) (**3Blue1Brown**). *The clearest picture of the decoder stack and how information flows through it.*
2. **Build one by hand** — watch [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) (**Andrej Karpathy**). *Every block, the causal mask, and the training loop coded line by line — the canonical way to truly get it.*
3. **Read it as code** — [GPT in 60 Lines of NumPy](https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-scratch/) (**Jay Mody**). *A complete, dependency-free decoder forward pass — nothing hidden.*
4. **Read the source** — the [GPT-3 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) (the decoder-only LM at scale) then [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) (the modern RMSNorm + RoPE + SwiGLU recipe).
5. **Trace inference** — [How a Transformer works at inference vs training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGu7ivuy1Ag) (**Niels Rogge**). *Why generation is one-token-at-a-time, which motivates prefill/decode and the KV cache.*
