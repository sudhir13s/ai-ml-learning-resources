# Citations & Attribution — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Citations & Attribution](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/rag-and-knowledge-systems/citations-and-attribution/citations-and-attribution)** (the
> concept page). External sources *and* internal cross-links, kept separate so it can be reused as a
> standalone list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free/open (no paywall) and chosen for
> depth on *this* topic — attaching each claim in a RAG answer to its source passage (attribution),
> measuring citation quality (precision/recall), and the entailment judge that separates a real
> citation from a topical one. Every formula/mechanism cited on the concept page (ALCE citation
> recall/precision, AIS attribution, the NLI entailment support function) appears here as a primary
> source.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See the methods** — read [How to get a model to cite sources](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/qa_citations/) (**LangChain**). *The menu of citation techniques (tool-calling IDs, snippets, prompting, post-processing), with code.*
2. **Make citations verifiable** — watch [RAG — but with Verified Citations!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGzSnhQKPM) (**Trelis Research**). *Forcing citations to point at spans that genuinely support each claim — the entailment idea in practice.*
3. **Use model-native citations** — read [Anthropic: Introducing Citations](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-citations-api) + the [Citations docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations). *Generation-time, sentence-level grounding built into the API — `cited_text` + character spans.*
4. **Know the metrics precisely** — skim [ALCE (Gao et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14627). *Citation recall & precision via an NLI entailment model — the metrics this chapter derives.*
5. **Read the foundation** — skim [AIS: Measuring Attribution in NLG (Rashkin et al. 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12870). *"Attributable to Identified Sources" — the definition of attribution the whole field builds on.*
