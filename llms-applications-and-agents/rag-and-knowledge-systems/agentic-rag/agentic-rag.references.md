# Agentic RAG — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Agentic RAG](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/rag-and-knowledge-systems/agentic-rag/agentic-rag)** (the concept page). External
> sources *and* internal cross-links, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone list. Grouped
> by type, best-first. Every entry is free/open (no paywall) and chosen for depth on *this* topic —
> putting an LLM in a decision loop over retrieval: the ReAct loop, tool use, routing, multi-step /
> self-correcting retrieval, and the cost/latency tradeoffs. Every formula/mechanism cited on the
> concept page (ReAct, Reflexion, Toolformer, routing, Adaptive-RAG) appears here as a primary source.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the framing** — watch [What is Agentic RAG?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z9_MhcYvcY) (**IBM Technology**). *Static pipeline → an agent that decides, grades, and acts.*
2. **See the evolution** — watch [RAG's Evolution: From Simple Retrieval to Agentic AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2P5Gk23VI) (**IBM Technology**). *How naive → advanced → agentic RAG progresses, and why.*
3. **Read the loop's primary source** — read [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) (**Yao et al. 2022**), §2. *Reason → Act → Observe: the control loop the whole chapter is built on.*
4. **Read the pattern write-up** — read [Weaviate: What is Agentic RAG?](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-agentic-rag). *Agents, tools, routing, and validation around retrieval, clearly framed.*
5. **Build a routing / self-correcting agent** — watch [Self-reflective RAG with LangGraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbAd8O1Lvm4) (**LangChain**), then follow [LangGraph: build a RAG agent](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/agentic-rag). *Route by complexity, grade docs, retry — in a real stateful graph.*
