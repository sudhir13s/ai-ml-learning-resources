# Re-ranking with Cross-Encoders — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Re-ranking with Cross-Encoders](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/rag-and-knowledge-systems/reranking/reranking)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is a free, no-paywall link from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic (two-stage retrieve-then-rerank and the cross-encoder that does the precision stage), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the two-stage picture** — read [Rerankers and Two-Stage Retrieval](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/rag/rerankers/) (**Pinecone**). *Why a cheap recall stage + an accurate rerank stage beats either alone.*
2. **See the architecture difference** — read [Retrieve & Re-Rank](https://sbert.net/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html) (**Sentence-Transformers**). *Bi-encoder (independent) vs cross-encoder (joint) encoding, with runnable code.*
3. **Watch it in a pipeline** — watch [Reranking with Sentence Transformers and BM25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V58mPkLB95o) (**Sunny Savita**). *Plugs a cross-encoder onto first-stage results end to end.*
4. **Read the cross-encoder source** — skim [Passage Re-ranking with BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04085) (**Nogueira & Cho 2019**). *The paper that established BERT cross-encoders as re-rankers — the score on the page.*
5. **Understand why two stages** — skim [Sentence-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) (**Reimers & Gurevych 2019**), §1–2. *The cost argument (a forward pass per pair) that forces bi-encoder retrieval + cross-encoder re-ranking.*
