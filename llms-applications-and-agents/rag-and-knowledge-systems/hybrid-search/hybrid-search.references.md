# Hybrid Search (BM25 + Dense) — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Hybrid Search (BM25 + Dense)](hybrid-search.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is a free, no-paywall link from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic (combining lexical and dense retrieval, and the fusion that does it), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Master the sparse baseline** — watch [A No-Nonsense Intro to BM25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW9vHU1GpU4) (**Abhishek Thakur**). *BM25 is the keyword half of hybrid; understand tf-saturation and length normalization first.*
2. **See why you need both** — read [Hybrid Search Explained](https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-explained) (**Weaviate**). *Where dense fails, where sparse fails, and how fusion fixes both — with the `alpha` dial.*
3. **Understand the fusion** — read [Getting Started with Hybrid Search](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/hybrid-search-intro/) (**Pinecone**). *Combining sparse + dense vectors and the weighting knob.*
4. **Read the fusion source** — skim [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Cormack et al. 2009)](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormack/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf). *The one-line, rank-based fusion behind every production hybrid stack — and the $k=60$ default.*
5. **Get the BM25 math right** — read [The Probabilistic Relevance Framework: BM25 and Beyond](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf) (**Robertson & Zaragoza**), §3. *The full BM25 derivation — IDF, saturation ($k_1$), length-norm ($b$).*

- [Hybrid Search Explained](https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-explained) — **Weaviate** — clear account of why hybrid wins, the `alpha` dial (0 = BM25, 1 = vector), and the two fusion methods (relativeScoreFusion vs rankedFusion).
- [Getting Started with Hybrid Search](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/hybrid-search-intro/) — **Pinecone** — combining sparse + dense vectors with a tunable weighting; the sparse-dense index idea.

- [The Probabilistic Relevance Framework: BM25 and Beyond](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf) — **Robertson & Zaragoza (FnTIR 2009)** — the canonical BM25 derivation; §3 gives the saturation-and-length-normalization scoring function and the probabilistic IDF the page's formula is taken from.
- [Reciprocal Rank Fusion Outperforms Condorcet and Individual Rank Learning Methods](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormack/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) — **Cormack, Clarke & Büttcher (SIGIR 2009)** — introduces RRF (Eq. 1) and the $k=60$ constant; the source for the rank-fusion formula on the page.
- [An Analysis of Fusion Functions for Hybrid Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11934) — **Bruch, Gai & Ingber (ACM TOIS 2023)** — analyzes convex-combination (weighted-sum) fusion of normalized lexical + dense scores; the source for the min-max-normalize-then-weight formula and the "tuned convex combination can beat RRF" claim.
- [SPLADE: Sparse Lexical and Expansion Model for First-Stage Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05720) — **Formal et al. (2021)** — learned sparse retrieval that beats BM25 while staying interpretable; the modern evolution of the lexical lens.
- [Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain QA (DPR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) — **Karpukhin et al. (2020)** — the dense dual-encoder that hybrid pairs with BM25; established that learned dense retrieval beats BM25 on many tasks (but not all — motivating fusion).
- [BEIR: A Heterogeneous Benchmark for Zero-Shot IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08663) — **Thakur et al. (2021)** — shows BM25 is a tough zero-shot baseline that dense models don't uniformly beat, the empirical case for keeping the lexical lens.
- [A Replication Study of Dense Passage Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05740) — **Ma, Sun, Pradeep & Lin (2021)** — shows the original DPR work under-reported the BM25 baseline, and that **dense–sparse hybrid** retrieval is stronger than either alone — the empirical case for fusing the two lenses.
