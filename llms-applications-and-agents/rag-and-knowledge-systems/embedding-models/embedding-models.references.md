# Embedding Models for Retrieval — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Embedding Models for Retrieval](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/rag-and-knowledge-systems/embedding-models/embedding-models)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is a free, no-paywall link from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic (the embedding model that defines retrieval geometry), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See what an embedding *is* for search** — watch [Intro to Sentence Embeddings with Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS1uVMGhlWQ) (**James Briggs**). *Grounds the "sentence → vector → cosine similarity" pipeline you retrieve with.*
2. **Connect it to retrieval** — watch [Introduction to Semantic Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcJZ6XWrTEA) (**Luis Serrano, Cohere**). *Why dense retrieval beats keyword search, told visually.*
3. **Get the asymmetry right** — read [Sentence-Transformers: Semantic Search](https://www.sbert.net/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/semantic-search/README.html). *Symmetric vs asymmetric search and how to encode queries vs documents correctly.*
4. **Choose a model deliberately** — read [Choosing an Embedding Model](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/rag/embedding-models-rundown/) (**Pinecone**) + the [MTEB blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb) (**Hugging Face**). *How to read the Retrieval task — not the headline average.*
5. **Read the source** — skim [Dense Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) (**Karpukhin et al. 2020**). *The dual-encoder + in-batch negatives that proved dense retrievers beat BM25.*
