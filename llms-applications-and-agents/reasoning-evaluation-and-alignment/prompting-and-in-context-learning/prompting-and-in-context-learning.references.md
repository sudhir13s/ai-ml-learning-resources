# Prompting & In-Context Learning — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Prompting & In-Context Learning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/reasoning-evaluation-and-alignment/prompting-and-in-context-learning/prompting-and-in-context-learning)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity, and free / no paywall.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the mental model** — watch [Intro to Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g) (**Andrej Karpathy**). *Frames prompting as conditioning a next-token predictor — the foundation for everything below.*
2. **Read the source** — skim [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (GPT-3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) (**Brown et al. 2020**), §2–3. *Where zero/one/few-shot ICL was demonstrated at scale.*
3. **See the mechanism** — read [In-context Learning and Induction Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) (**Olsson et al., Anthropic**). *The induction-head circuit behind copying-from-context — the page's Experiment 1, in real models.*
4. **Understand the brittleness** — read [Calibrate Before Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09690) (**Zhao et al. 2021**). *Majority-label/recency bias and the content-free calibration fix — the page's Experiment 3, plus the cure.*
5. **Learn the practical toolkit** — work through the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) (**DAIR.AI**). *Zero/few-shot, roles, delimiters, structured outputs — the hands-on patterns.*

- [Fantastically Ordered Prompts and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08786) — **Lu et al. (2021)** — demonstration *order* swings few-shot accuracy from near-chance to near-SOTA; good orderings are hard to find a priori.

(2022, Anthropic / Transformer Circuits)** — the induction-head mechanism and its phase-change co-occurrence with ICL ability; the core of the page's mechanism section.
