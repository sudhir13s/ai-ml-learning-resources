# Chain-of-Thought Reasoning — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/llms-applications-and-agents/reasoning-evaluation-and-alignment/chain-of-thought-and-reasoning/chain-of-thought-and-reasoning)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. All links are free / no-paywall.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the intuition** — watch [Chain-of-Thought Prompting — Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFE6x81AP4k) (**CodeEmporium**). *What CoT is and why writing steps before the answer helps.*
2. **Read the source** — [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) (**Wei et al. 2022**). *The founding few-shot result and the emergent-at-scale finding.*
3. **See the minimal trigger** — [Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916) (**Kojima et al. 2022**). *"Let's think step by step" — zero-shot CoT, no examples.*
4. **Boost reliability** — [Self-Consistency Improves CoT Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171) (**Wang et al. 2022**). *Sample many chains, majority-vote — the key practical upgrade.*
5. **Connect to the frontier** — [Learning to Reason with LLMs (o1)](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) (**OpenAI**). *CoT as a trained capability and a test-time-compute dial.*
