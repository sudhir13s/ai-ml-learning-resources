# LLM Evaluation & Benchmarks — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[LLM Evaluation & Benchmarks](llm-evaluation.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free / open-access; every paper is linked by its arXiv ID. Sources cited in the page's `Source / derivation` blockquotes all appear in **Papers** (or **Books**) below.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the landscape** — watch [What are LLM Benchmarks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDY4TodQwbg) (**IBM Technology**). *MMLU, scoring, and what benchmarks do and don't measure.*
2. **Feel why it's hard** — watch [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) (**Andrej Karpathy**, eval section). *How models are evaluated across the whole pipeline, and where it breaks.*
3. **Do the perplexity math** — read [Speech and Language Processing, Ch. 3 §3.7](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf) (**Jurafsky & Martin**). *Perplexity = inverse geometric-mean probability = exp(cross-entropy), derived.*
4. **See preference eval** — read [Chatbot Arena (LMSYS)](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/) (**LMSYS**). *Elo from human pairwise votes — the live leaderboard.*
5. **Read the judge biases** — [Judging LLM-as-a-Judge (MT-Bench)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) (**Zheng et al. 2023**). *LLM judges, their biases, and ~80% human agreement.*
6. **Run an eval** — [EleutherAI lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). *The standard tool behind the Open LLM Leaderboard.*
