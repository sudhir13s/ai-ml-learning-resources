# Guardrails & Hallucination Mitigation — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Guardrails & Hallucination Mitigation](hallucination-and-grounding.md)**
> (the concept page). External sources *and* internal cross-links, kept separate so it can be reused as
> a standalone list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free/open (no paywall) and chosen for
> depth on *this* topic — input/output rails, prompt-injection defense, grounding-based abstention, and
> the false-refuse/false-allow tradeoff. Every formula/mechanism cited on the concept page (indirect
> prompt injection, Llama Guard, NeMo Guardrails, selective prediction / risk-coverage) appears here as
> a primary source.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the concept** — watch [What are guardrails for LLMs?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLOXGvqdwbM) (**Red Hat**). *Input/output rails and why you wrap the model with checks.*
2. **See the categories** — read [What Are AI Guardrails?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-guardrails) (**IBM**). *The taxonomy (safety, topic, fact-check, PII) and where each rail sits.*
3. **Know the attack** — skim [Indirect Prompt Injection (Greshake et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173). *Why a retrieved document can hijack your LLM — the threat input rails defend against.*
4. **Build output rails** — watch [How to implement LLM guardrails for RAG applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5K4r_TJz_8) (**IBM Developer**). *Fact-checking retrieved context + blocking unsafe outputs in a RAG pipeline.*
5. **Read the sources** — skim [NeMo Guardrails (Rebedea et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10501) and [Llama Guard (Inan et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06674). *Programmable rails, and the trained input/output safety classifier.*
