# Hallucination & Alignment Basics — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Hallucination & Alignment Basics](safety-and-alignment.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer, free / open-access, chosen for depth on *this* topic. Every formula on the concept page cites a source here.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the intuition** — watch [Why Large Language Models Hallucinate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfqtFvWOfg0) (**IBM Technology**). *The clearest short intro to types, causes, and mitigations.*
2. **Get the incentive argument** — read [Why Language Models Hallucinate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664) (**Kalai et al. 2025**). *Hallucination is the optimal response to a train/eval rule that punishes "I don't know."*
3. **Get the taxonomy & survey** — read [Extrinsic Hallucinations in LLMs](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/) (**Lilian Weng**). *The definitive free survey: taxonomy, detection, mitigation.*
4. **See the alignment mechanism** — watch [RLHF, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPN_XZcJf_s) (**StatQuest**) then read [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) (**Ouyang et al. 2022**). *What preference tuning actually optimizes.*
5. **Connect the fixes** — [RLHF & DPO](../../training-and-adaptation/preference-and-alignment-training/preference-and-alignment-training.md) (preference tuning) + [RAG](../../rag-and-knowledge-systems/overview.md) (grounding) + [Decoding & Sampling](../../inference-and-runtime/decoding-and-sampling/decoding-and-sampling.md) (temperature). *The main levers, each its own chapter.*
