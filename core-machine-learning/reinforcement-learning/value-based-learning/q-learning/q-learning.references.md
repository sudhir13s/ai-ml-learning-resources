# Q-Learning — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Q-Learning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/value-based-learning/q-learning/q-learning)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free / open (no paywall) and from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *Q-learning specifically* (the off-policy TD-control update, its Bellman-optimality derivation, convergence, and the SARSA contrast), not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch ⭐ [RL Course, Lecture 5: Model-Free Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g4j2k_Ggc4) by **David Silver (DeepMind)**. *Derives Q-learning and SARSA side by side — the cleanest on-policy-vs-off-policy explanation anywhere.*
2. **Read the source chapter** — [Sutton & Barto, §6.5 "Q-learning: Off-policy TD Control"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf) (free PDF). *The update rule, the off-policy property, and the CliffWalking-vs-SARSA comparison (Example 6.6) this page reproduces.*
3. **See it implemented** — read [An introduction to Q-Learning: reinforcement learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit2/q-learning) (**Hugging Face Deep RL Course**, Thomas Simonini). *Builds the Q-table + ε-greedy loop step by step, then trains on FrozenLake — the same environment this page proves optimal.*
4. **Cement the derivation** — read the [Q-learning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992698) paper (**Watkins & Dayan, 1992**). *Short, readable, and the origin of both the algorithm and its convergence proof.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run this chapter's [notebook](code/q-learning.ipynb): from-scratch tabular Q-learning on real Gymnasium `FrozenLake-v1` and `CliffWalking-v1`, with the learned policy asserted equal to the value-iteration optimum.

**In this platform**:
- Concept page (full explanation): [Q-Learning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/value-based-learning/q-learning/q-learning)
- Runnable code: [the module `q_learning.py`](code/q_learning.py) · [the step-by-step notebook](code/q-learning.ipynb) — from-scratch tabular Q-learning on real Gymnasium `FrozenLake-v1` and `CliffWalking-v1`, with value iteration as ground truth and the learned greedy policy asserted equal to the DP optimum (gap 0; greedy return −13 = V* on the cliff); every number measured, none fabricated.
- The framework it lives in: [01 Markov Decision Processes](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/foundations/markov-decision-processes/markov-decision-processes) — states, actions, transitions, reward, and $\gamma$, the language Q-learning is written in.
- The equations it approximates: [02 Bellman Equations](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/foundations/bellman-equations/bellman-equations) — the Bellman optimality equation for $Q^*$ that the Q-learning target samples.
- The ground truth it is checked against: [03 Dynamic Programming (Value & Policy Iteration)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/foundations/dynamic-programming-value-and-policy-iteration/dynamic-programming-value-and-policy-iteration) — the model-based optimum this page proves Q-learning recovers.
- The learning update it uses: [05 Temporal-Difference Learning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/value-based-learning/temporal-difference-learning/temporal-difference-learning) — TD prediction; Q-learning is TD *control* with a greedy target.
- The on-policy contrast: [07 SARSA](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/value-based-learning/sarsa/sarsa) — the same loop with an on-policy target; the CliffWalking Example 6.6 counterpart.
- The exploration knob: [14 Exploration vs Exploitation](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/foundations/exploration-vs-exploitation/exploration-vs-exploitation) — ε-greedy and the trade-off that satisfies Q-learning's "visit everything" convergence condition.
- Where it scales next: [08 Deep Q-Networks (DQN)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/reinforcement-learning/value-based-learning/deep-q-networks-dqn/deep-q-networks-dqn) — Q-learning with a neural network replacing the table, for large or continuous state spaces.
