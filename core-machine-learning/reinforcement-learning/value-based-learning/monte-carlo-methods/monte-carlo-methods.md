# Monte Carlo Methods
> Learn values by **averaging complete returns** from sampled episodes — no model needed. Play an
> episode to the end, look at the actual return that followed each state, and average over many
> episodes. It's the most direct embodiment of "value = expected return," and the natural contrast
> to the bootstrapping of TD learning.

**Why it matters:** the first model-free method, and the classic "MC vs TD" interview question —
MC is unbiased but high-variance and needs episodes to terminate; TD is biased (bootstraps) but
lower-variance and works online. Also where first-visit vs every-visit, exploring starts, and
on- vs off-policy (importance sampling) first appear.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [David Silver Lecture 4: Model-Free Prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnHCvfgC_ZA). *Introduces MC prediction as averaging sampled returns, then contrasts with TD.*
2. **Read the chapter** — [Sutton & Barto Ch. 5 "Monte Carlo Methods"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *First-visit vs every-visit MC, MC control with exploring starts, off-policy MC via importance sampling.*
3. **See MC control** — [David Silver Lecture 5: Model-Free Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g4j2k_Ggc4). *How MC estimates of Q drive ε-greedy policy improvement.*
4. **Place it on the map** — [Lilian Weng: RL overview (MC section)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/). *Where MC sits between exact DP and bootstrapping TD.*
