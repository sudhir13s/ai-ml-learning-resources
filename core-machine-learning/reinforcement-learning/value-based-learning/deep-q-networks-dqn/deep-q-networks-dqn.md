# Deep Q-Networks (DQN + variants)
> Q-learning where the Q-table is replaced by a neural network `Q(s,a;θ)` — so it scales to raw pixels.
> The breakthrough was making it *stable*: an **experience replay** buffer (break correlation between
> consecutive samples) plus a slowly-updated **target network** (stop the bootstrap target from chasing
> its own tail). This is what learned to play Atari from pixels and launched deep RL.

**Why it matters:** the most-asked deep-RL interview topic. Be ready to explain why naïve "neural
Q-learning" diverges (the deadly triad: bootstrapping + off-policy + function approximation), how
replay and target networks fix it, and the variant ladder — **Double DQN** (decouple selection from
evaluation to cut overestimation), **Dueling** (split value/advantage streams), **Prioritized replay**
(sample high-TD-error transitions), and **Rainbow** (combine them all).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Pieter Abbeel L2: Deep Q-Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psrhxy88zww). *The cleanest modern derivation of DQN: replay, target net, and the loss.*
2. **Read the source** — [Human-level control through deep RL (DQN, Nature 2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236). *The paper; focus on the replay + target-network stability tricks and the Atari results.*
3. **Get the variants** — [Lilian Weng: DQN and its extensions](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/). *Double, Dueling, Prioritized, and how Rainbow combines them.*
4. **Code it** — [Johnny Code: DQN explained & implemented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrWGTCGzlA). *Build the replay buffer + target network in PyTorch end to end.*
