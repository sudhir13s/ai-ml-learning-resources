# SARSA (on-policy TD control)
> Q-learning's on-policy twin. The name is the transition it uses — **S**tate, **A**ction, **R**eward,
> next **S**tate, next **A**ction — and the update bootstraps on the action *actually taken next*:
> `Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ Q(s',a') − Q(s,a)]`. Because it evaluates the policy it follows
> (exploration included), SARSA learns a *safer* policy near hazards than the optimistic Q-learning.

**Why it matters:** the other half of the "on-policy vs off-policy" interview question. You'll be
asked why SARSA uses `Q(s',a')` instead of `max_{a'} Q(s',a')`, what the classic cliff-walking example
shows (SARSA takes the safe path, Q-learning the risky optimal one), and what Expected SARSA changes.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [David Silver Lecture 5: Model-Free Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g4j2k_Ggc4). *Derives SARSA right next to Q-learning; the clearest on-vs-off-policy framing.*
2. **Read the chapter** — [Sutton & Barto §6.4–6.6](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *SARSA, Expected SARSA, and the cliff-walking experiment that distinguishes it from Q-learning.*
3. **See the cliff-walk** — [Lilian Weng: RL overview (SARSA section)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/). *Why an on-policy agent learns to keep a safety margin.*
4. **Code it** — adapt a tabular agent to use the next-action target instead of the `max`. *One line changes — and the learned path changes — which cements the distinction.*
