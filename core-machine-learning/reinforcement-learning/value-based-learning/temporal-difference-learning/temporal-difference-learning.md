# Temporal-Difference Learning
> The idea that makes RL *online*: update a value estimate toward a **bootstrapped target** —
> `V(s) ← V(s) + α[r + γV(s') − V(s)]` — using the very next step instead of waiting for the episode
> to end. The bracketed quantity is the **TD error**, the single most important signal in RL (it even
> matches dopamine in the brain). TD(λ) and n-step methods interpolate smoothly between TD(0) and Monte Carlo.

**Why it matters:** TD is the engine under Q-learning, SARSA, and every actor-critic. The interview
staple is "MC vs TD vs DP" (sampling vs bootstrapping vs both), what the TD error is, why bootstrapping
trades bias for lower variance, and how the λ in TD(λ) and eligibility traces unify the family.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [David Silver Lecture 4: Model-Free Prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnHCvfgC_ZA). *Introduces the TD update and the TD error, directly against MC.*
2. **Read the chapter** — [Sutton & Barto Ch. 6 "Temporal-Difference Learning"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *TD(0), the TD error, batch TD vs MC, and why TD often learns faster.*
3. **Get TD(λ) & traces** — [Sutton & Barto Ch. 7 & 12](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *n-step TD and eligibility traces — the spectrum from one-step TD to full-return MC.*
4. **Place it on the map** — [Lilian Weng: RL overview (TD section)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/). *Where bootstrapping sits and why it powers Q-learning/SARSA next.*
