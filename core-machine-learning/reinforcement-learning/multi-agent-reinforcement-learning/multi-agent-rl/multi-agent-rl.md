# Multi-Agent RL (MARL)
> Many agents learn *simultaneously* in a shared environment — cooperating, competing, or both. The
> twist that breaks single-agent RL: from any one agent's view the environment is **non-stationary**,
> because the other agents are changing their policies too, so the "MDP" keeps shifting under your feet.
> Solutions include **centralized training with decentralized execution** (CTDE — e.g. **MADDPG**, where
> a centralized critic sees all agents but each actor runs alone), and **self-play** (an agent improves
> by playing copies of itself — the engine behind AlphaGo and OpenAI Five).

**Why it matters:** the frontier for games, markets, robotics swarms, and autonomous driving, and an
increasingly common interview topic. Be ready to explain the non-stationarity problem, the CTDE paradigm
and why MADDPG's centralized critic helps, the difference between cooperative/competitive/mixed settings
(Nash equilibria), and why self-play produces an automatic curriculum.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Autocurricula](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07528). *A vivid demonstration (hide-and-seek) of multi-agent self-play producing emergent strategies.*
2. **Get the core method** — [MADDPG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275). *Centralized-critic, decentralized-actor (CTDE) — the standard MARL algorithm.*
3. **Get the survey** — [A Survey and Critique of Multi-Agent Deep RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05587). *Non-stationarity, credit assignment, and the MARL algorithm families, in one open reference.*
4. **See self-play at scale** — [OpenAI Five](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06680) / [AlphaStar](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z). *Self-play + RL beating top humans at Dota 2 and StarCraft II.*
