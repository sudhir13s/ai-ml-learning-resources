# Reinforcement Learning
> Learning by trial and reward — MDPs, value & policy methods, deep RL, and the RLHF that
> aligns modern LLMs.

**⭐ Start here:** [Hugging Face Deep RL Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course) — free, hands-on, you train agents.

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) with its page — a short guided
learning path plus the best **free, open** courses, videos, papers, articles, and books for that topic.
> **✅ ready.** New to RL? Start with the field overview below, then work top to bottom.
