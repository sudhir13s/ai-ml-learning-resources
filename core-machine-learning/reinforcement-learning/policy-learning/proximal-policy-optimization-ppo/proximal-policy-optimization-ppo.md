# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
> TRPO's reliability without TRPO's machinery. PPO keeps the policy update inside a trust region using
> a **clipped surrogate objective**: it multiplies the advantage by the probability ratio
> `r(θ) = π_new/π_old`, then *clips* that ratio to `[1−ε, 1+ε]` so the update can't move the policy too
> far in one step — all with plain first-order SGD. Simple, stable, sample-efficient enough to reuse a
> batch for several epochs. It is the default deep-RL algorithm and the RL engine inside RLHF.

**Why it matters:** the single most-asked deep-RL interview topic. Write the clipped objective, explain
why clipping approximates TRPO's KL trust region, how the min(clipped, unclipped) prevents over-large
updates in both directions, the roles of the value loss and entropy bonus, and — crucially — how PPO is
the optimizer in **RLHF** (the policy is the LLM, the reward comes from a learned reward model, plus a
KL penalty to the reference model).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Arxiv Insights: Policy Gradients & PPO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P7I-xPq8u8). *The clearest visual story of the step-size problem and the clip that fixes it.*
2. **Read the canonical explainer** — [Spinning Up: PPO](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ppo.html). *The clipped objective, GAE advantages, and the full update loop with pseudocode.*
3. **Get the derivation** — [Lilian Weng: Policy Gradient (PPO section)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-04-08-policy-gradient/). *PPO as a first-order approximation to TRPO's trust region.*
4. **Read the source + lecture** — [PPO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) and [Deep RL Bootcamp L5 (Schulman)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvRrgxcpaHY). *The author's own framing, TRPO → PPO.*
