# Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
> Plain policy gradients take a step in parameter space and can fall off a cliff — one bad update
> collapses the policy. TRPO instead takes the **largest improving step that stays within a trust
> region**: maximize the surrogate advantage objective subject to a hard constraint that the new
> policy's KL divergence from the old one is small. This *monotonic-improvement* guarantee is what
> made deep policy optimization reliable — and PPO is its cheaper approximation.

**Why it matters:** the conceptual parent of PPO and the standard "why constrain the policy update?"
question. Be ready to explain the surrogate objective, the KL trust-region constraint, why it gives
(approximate) monotonic improvement, and why the natural-gradient / conjugate-gradient + Fisher-vector
machinery is expensive — which is exactly the pain PPO removes with a clipped objective.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [Spinning Up: TRPO](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/trpo.html). *The surrogate objective and KL constraint explained without drowning in the natural-gradient algebra.*
2. **Get the derivation** — [Lilian Weng: Policy Gradient (TRPO section)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-04-08-policy-gradient/). *The monotonic-improvement bound and where the KL trust region comes from.*
3. **Watch the lecture** — [Deep RL Bootcamp L5: Natural PG, TRPO, PPO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvRrgxcpaHY). *John Schulman (the author) walks through natural gradients → TRPO → PPO.*
4. **Read the source** — [TRPO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477). *The theorem, the practical approximations (conjugate gradient, line search), and the experiments.*
