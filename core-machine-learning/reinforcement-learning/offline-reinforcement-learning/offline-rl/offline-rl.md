# Offline RL (batch RL)
> Learn a policy from a **fixed, pre-collected dataset** — no further interaction with the environment.
> This is how RL becomes usable where exploration is costly or dangerous (healthcare, robotics, recommendation).
> The core difficulty is **distribution shift**: the learned policy queries `Q` at actions the dataset
> never covered, where the value estimates are wildly overoptimistic and there's no way to correct them.
> Methods like **CQL** (conservatively lower-bound out-of-distribution Q-values) and policy-constraint
> approaches (**BCQ/BEAR**) keep the policy close to the data.

**Why it matters:** a hot research and applied area, and a sharp senior interview question. Be ready to
explain why naively running Q-learning/SAC on logged data fails (bootstrapping off OOD actions →
extrapolation error), what distributional shift is, and how CQL and behavior-constraint methods fix it.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [BAIR Blog: Offline RL](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/12/07/offline/). *Why offline RL is hard (distribution shift) and the families of fixes, by the survey's authors.*
2. **Read the survey** — [Offline RL: Tutorial, Review, and Perspectives (Levine et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01643). *The definitive reference: problem formulation, error sources, and methods.*
3. **Get the lecture** — [NeurIPS 2020 Offline RL Tutorial](https://sites.google.com/view/offlinerltutorial-neurips2020/home). *Levine & Kumar's video tutorial with slides — the clearest spoken walkthrough.*
4. **Get the key method** — [Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04779). *How conservatively lower-bounding Q on OOD actions prevents overestimation.*
