# Multi-Armed Bandits
> The simplest RL setting — one state, `k` actions ("arms"), each with an unknown reward distribution.
> No transitions, no credit assignment over time: pure **exploration vs exploitation**. Pull arms,
> learn their means, and minimize **regret** (the gap to always pulling the best arm). **Contextual
> bandits** add features per round (the model behind ad/recommendation/clinical-trial allocation),
> bridging to full RL.

**Why it matters:** the cleanest place to *prove* exploration results, and a direct interview/industry
topic (A/B testing, recommendations, ad allocation). Be ready to define regret, derive/state UCB1's
logarithmic regret, explain Thompson sampling (Bayesian posterior sampling), and the difference between
context-free and contextual bandits — and why a bandit is "an MDP with one state."

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — read [Lilian Weng: The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-01-23-multi-armed-bandit/). *ε-greedy, UCB1, and Thompson sampling with regret, all in one place.*
2. **Get the chapter** — [Sutton & Barto Ch. 2 "Multi-armed Bandits"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *Action-value estimation, ε-greedy, optimistic init, UCB, gradient bandits.*
3. **Watch the lecture** — [David Silver Lecture 9: Exploration & Exploitation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuiWX07sKw). *Frames bandits as the regret-minimization core of exploration.*
4. **Go rigorous** — [Bandit Algorithms (Lattimore & Szepesvári)](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf). *The definitive free book: stochastic, adversarial, and contextual bandits with proofs.*
