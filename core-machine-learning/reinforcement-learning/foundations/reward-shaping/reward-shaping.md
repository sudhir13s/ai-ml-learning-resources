# Reward Shaping
> Sparse rewards ("+1 only at the goal") make learning agonizingly slow — the agent rarely stumbles
> onto reward to learn from. **Reward shaping** adds an auxiliary signal to guide it. The key theorem:
> **potential-based reward shaping** `F(s,s') = γΦ(s') − Φ(s)` adds dense guidance *without changing the
> optimal policy* — any other shaping risks **reward hacking** (the agent optimizes the proxy, not the
> task). Alternatives to hand-shaping: **Hindsight Experience Replay** (relabel failures as successes
> for whatever they did achieve) and intrinsic curiosity.

**Why it matters:** the practical "my agent won't learn — the reward is too sparse" problem, and a
classic trap question. Be ready to state why arbitrary shaping changes the optimum, why *potential-based*
shaping provably doesn't (Ng, Harada & Russell), what reward hacking is, and how HER sidesteps shaping
entirely in goal-conditioned tasks.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Arxiv Insights: RL with sparse rewards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ey02HT_1Ho). *Why sparse reward is hard and the shaping / HER / curiosity options.*
2. **Get the theorem** — read [Ng, Harada & Russell: Policy Invariance under Reward Transformations](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa09/readings/NgHaradaRussell-shaping-ICML1999.pdf). *The potential-based shaping result — the one fact to know cold.*
3. **Get HER** — [Hindsight Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495). *Relabel goals so every episode yields learnable reward — no manual shaping.*
4. **See the failure mode** — [DeepMind: Specification gaming (reward hacking)](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity/). *Vivid examples of agents maximizing the proxy reward, not the intended task.*
