# Bellman Equations
> The recursive heart of RL: the value of a state equals the immediate reward plus the discounted
> value of where you land next. This self-consistency turns an infinite sum over the future into a
> single one-step equation — `V(s) = E[r + γ V(s')]` — and its **optimality** form
> `V*(s) = max_a E[r + γ V*(s')]` defines the best possible behavior.

**Why it matters:** the equation every value-based method (DP, TD, Q-learning, DQN) is secretly
solving. Interviewers ask you to write the Bellman expectation vs optimality equations, explain the
`max` vs expectation, why it's a contraction (so iteration converges), and how the *Bellman error*
becomes the TD target.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [David Silver Lecture 2 (value & Bellman)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHX2hHRMVQ). *Derives the Bellman expectation equation directly from the definition of return.*
2. **Get the optimality form** — read [Sutton & Barto §3.5–3.6](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *The Bellman optimality equations for V\* and Q\*, with the backup-diagram pictures.*
3. **See why iteration converges** — [Lilian Weng: RL overview (Bellman section)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/). *The γ-contraction argument — why repeatedly applying the Bellman operator finds the fixed point.*
4. **Make it concrete** — trace the equation through a grid-world in [David Silver Lecture 3 (DP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd1-UUMVfz4). *Watch value iteration apply the Bellman optimality backup until it converges.*
