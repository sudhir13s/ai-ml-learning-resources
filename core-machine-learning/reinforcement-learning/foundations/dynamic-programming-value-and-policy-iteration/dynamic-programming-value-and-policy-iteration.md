# Dynamic Programming — Value & Policy Iteration
> When you **know the model** (transitions and rewards), you can solve an MDP exactly by repeatedly
> applying the Bellman backup. **Policy iteration** alternates evaluating a policy and greedily
> improving it; **value iteration** folds both into one `max` backup. These are the ground-truth
> planners that every model-free method approximates by sampling.

**Why it matters:** the bridge from Bellman equations to algorithms. Interviewers ask the difference
between policy iteration and value iteration, why both converge (contraction + policy-improvement
theorem), their complexity, and why DP needs a known model — which motivates Monte Carlo and TD.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [David Silver Lecture 3: Planning by DP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd1-UUMVfz4). *The definitive walkthrough of policy evaluation, policy iteration, and value iteration.*
2. **Read the chapter** — [Sutton & Barto Ch. 4 "Dynamic Programming"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *Policy-evaluation sweeps, the policy-improvement theorem, generalized policy iteration (GPI).*
3. **Compare the two** — [Steve Brunton: Model-Based RL — Policy & Value Iteration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJIFUTITfBc). *Side-by-side of the two algorithms and when each is cheaper.*
4. **Code it** — implement value iteration on a grid-world following the [Spinning Up intro](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html). *Watch values propagate from the goal outward until the greedy policy stops changing.*
