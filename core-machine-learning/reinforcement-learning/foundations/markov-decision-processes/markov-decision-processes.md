# Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
> The mathematical frame for sequential decision-making: an agent in a **state** picks an **action**,
> the environment returns a **reward** and a (stochastic) **next state**, and this repeats. The
> "Markov" property says the next state depends only on the current state and action — the past is
> already summarized in the present. Every RL algorithm is, at bottom, solving an MDP.

**Why it matters:** the very first RL interview question — define an MDP `(S, A, P, R, γ)`, state the
Markov property, explain return vs reward, why we discount with γ, and the difference between a policy,
a value function, and the model. Get this wrong and nothing downstream (Bellman, Q-learning, PPO) makes sense.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [David Silver Lecture 2: MDPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHX2hHRMVQ). *The canonical lecture; sets up states, returns, value, and policy precisely.*
2. **See it formalized** — read [Spinning Up: Key Concepts in RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html). *Clean, modern definitions of state, action, reward, return, policy, value — the vocabulary you'll reuse everywhere.*
3. **Get the textbook treatment** — [Sutton & Barto Ch. 3 "Finite MDPs"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *Defines the MDP, the Markov property, returns, and the value functions you'll derive Bellman equations over next.*
4. **Cement the formalism** — work the grid-world examples in [Lilian Weng: A (Long) Peek into RL](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/). *Ties the pieces together with worked notation before you move on to Bellman.*
