# Model-Based RL
> Instead of learning values/policies purely from real experience, **learn (or use) a model** of the
> environment's dynamics `P(s'|s,a)` and reward, then **plan** with it. This buys dramatic sample
> efficiency — you can imagine rollouts instead of acting them. The spectrum runs from **Dyna**
> (interleave real learning with planning on a learned model), through **MPC** (replan a short horizon
> each step), to **MuZero** (learn a *latent* model and plan with MCTS — superhuman without being told
> the rules).

**Why it matters:** the "sample efficiency" axis of RL and a frequent senior-level question. Be ready to
contrast model-free vs model-based (sample efficiency vs model-bias / compounding error), explain Dyna's
planning–acting loop, what MPC does, and why MuZero's learned latent model + MCTS is a landmark.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Steve Brunton: Model-Based RL — Policy & Value Iteration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJIFUTITfBc). *Planning with a known model — the foundation model-based RL learns.*
2. **Get Dyna** — [Sutton & Barto Ch. 8 "Planning and Learning with Tabular Methods"](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). *Dyna-Q: interleaving model learning, planning, and acting.*
3. **Get the lecture** — [David Silver Lecture 8: Integrating Learning & Planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItMutbeOHtc). *Model learning, Dyna, and Monte-Carlo tree search.*
4. **See the frontier** — [MuZero (DeepMind blog)](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules/). *Learning a latent dynamics model and planning with MCTS, no rules given.*
