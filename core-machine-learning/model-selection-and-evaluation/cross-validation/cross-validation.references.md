# Cross-Validation — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Cross-Validation](cross-validation.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Cross Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSytzGwwBVw) (**StatQuest**). *See k-fold rotate the validation set so every point gets used.*
2. **See it in context** — watch [K-fold Cross Validation (ISLR 5.2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMfvd_hLssE) (**Stanford Online**). *LOOCV vs k-fold and the bias–variance of the estimate.*
3. **Get the math** — read [ISLR Ch. 5](https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLR-Seventh-Printing.pdf) + [ESL Ch. 7.10](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). *Validation-set, LOOCV, k-fold estimators and their bias–variance.*
4. **Avoid the trap** — read [scikit-learn: Cross-validation (and pitfalls)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html). *Stratified / grouped / time-series splits, and why preprocessing must live inside the loop.*
5. **Make it concrete** — wrap a `Pipeline` in [`cross_val_score` / `GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) so scaling is fit per-fold; then tune with nested CV.
