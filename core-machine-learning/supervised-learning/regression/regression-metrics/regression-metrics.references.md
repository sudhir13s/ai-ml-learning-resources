# Regression Metrics — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Regression Metrics](regression-metrics.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Linear Regression, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo) (**StatQuest**). *See residuals — the raw material every regression metric is built from.*
2. **See why we square** — watch [The Main Ideas of Fitting a Line (Least Squares)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaFPbb66DxQ) (**StatQuest**). *Why squared error (→ MSE/RMSE) is the default, and how it differs from absolute error.*
3. **Master R²** — watch [R-squared, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AQKmw14mHM) (**StatQuest**). *The variance-explained interpretation and how to read it honestly.*
4. **Get the math** — read [scikit-learn: Regression metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics) + [ISLR Ch. 3.1.3](https://www.statlearning.com/). *Exact formulas for MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², adjusted R².*
5. **Make it concrete** — compute `mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, `r2_score` on a dataset, then add one big outlier. *Watch RMSE jump while MAE barely moves.*
