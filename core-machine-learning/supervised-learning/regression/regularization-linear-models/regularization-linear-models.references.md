# Regularization for Linear Models — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Regularization for Linear Models (Ridge · Lasso · Elastic-Net)](regularization-linear-models.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Ridge (L2) Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30) (**StatQuest**). *How shrinking the slope reduces variance and prevents overfitting on small data.*
2. **See the contrast** — watch [Lasso (L1) Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGf0voTMlcs) then [Ridge vs Lasso, Visualized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm2C_gTAl8c) (**StatQuest**). *Why L1 zeroes coefficients (the diamond) and L2 only shrinks them.*
3. **Get the math** — read [ESL Ch. 3.4 "Shrinkage Methods"](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). *The constraint geometry, the closed-form Ridge solution, and SVD shrinkage.*
4. **Read the source** — skim the [Lasso retrospective](https://tibshirani.su.domains/ftp/lasso-retro.pdf) (**Tibshirani**) and the [Elastic-Net paper](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/elasticnet.pdf) (**Zou & Hastie**). *Why L1 selects, and why L1+L2 fixes its instability on correlated features.*
5. **Make it concrete** — implement with [scikit-learn Ridge / Lasso / ElasticNet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ridge-regression-and-classification). *Sweep `alpha`, plot the coefficient paths, watch features drop to zero under Lasso.*
