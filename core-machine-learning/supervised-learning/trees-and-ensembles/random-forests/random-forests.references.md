# Random Forests — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Random Forests](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/trees-and-ensembles/random-forests/random-forests)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Random Forests Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ) (**StatQuest**), then play with [MLU-Explain: Random Forest](https://mlu-explain.github.io/random-forest/). *See bootstrapped, feature-randomized trees vote.*
2. **See the details** — watch [Random Forests Part 2 (Missing Data & Clustering)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM) (**StatQuest**). *Proximities, imputation, and what a forest does beyond prediction.*
3. **Get the math** — read [ISLR Ch. 8.2.2](https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLR-Seventh-Printing.pdf) + [ESL Ch. 15](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). *Why feature subsampling decorrelates trees and the variance formula behind it.*
4. **Read the source** — skim [Random Forests](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf) (**Breiman 2001**). *The algorithm, OOB error, and a generalization bound.*
5. **Make it concrete** — tune [scikit-learn `RandomForestClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests); read OOB score and feature importances.

**Videos**:
- [Random Forests Part 1 — Building, Using, Evaluating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — the gentle, from-scratch build of a forest and OOB error.
- [Random Forests Part 2 — Missing Data & Clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — proximities, imputation, and what else a forest gives you.
- [Random Forest Algorithm, Clearly Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6VJ2RO66Ag) — **Normalized Nerd** — a clean visual walkthrough of bootstrap + feature randomness.
- [What is Random Forest?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkXX4h3qYm4) — **IBM Technology** — a crisp conceptual overview of why ensembling trees works.

**Interactive & visual**:
