# Stacking & Blending — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Stacking & Blending](stacking-and-blending.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Ensemble Learning: Bagging, Boosting & Stacking in 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLt4a8-316E) (**AssemblyAI**). *See where stacking sits among ensembles: a meta-model on top of base models.*
2. **See it built** — watch [Stacking (Ensemble Methods, L07.7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2emza6g80) (**Sebastian Raschka**). *A clear academic walkthrough of the two-level architecture and out-of-fold predictions.*
3. **Get the math** — read [ESL Ch. 8.8 "Model Averaging and Stacking"](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). *Why out-of-fold predictions and a simple meta-learner avoid overfitting.*
4. **Read the source** — skim [Wolpert: Stacked Generalization](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Stacked-generalization-Wolpert/82e34a7d1c7e58e6a9b32cf45fae67aca308e02a) and [Breiman: Stacked Regressions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00117832). *The original idea and the regression form with non-negativity constraints.*
5. **Make it concrete** — implement with [scikit-learn `StackingClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#stacked-generalization). *Stack diverse base models under a logistic-regression meta-learner; verify it beats each alone.*

**In this platform**:
- Concept page (full explanation): [Stacking & Blending](stacking-and-blending.md)
- The three ensemble families: [Bagging](../bagging/bagging.md) (average copies → ↓variance) · [Random Forests](../random-forests/random-forests.md) (bagging + feature randomness) · [Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)](../gradient-boosting-xgboost/gradient-boosting-xgboost.md) (chain copies → ↓bias) — stacking combines *different* algorithms via a learned meta-learner.
- The heart of leak-free stacking: [Cross-Validation](../../../model-selection-and-evaluation/cross-validation/cross-validation.md) — out-of-fold predictions are k-fold CV repurposed as meta-features.
- The error-decomposition lens: [Bias–Variance Tradeoff](../../../model-selection-and-evaluation/bias-variance-tradeoff/bias-variance-tradeoff.md) — why decorrelated (diverse) base learners make combination pay off.
