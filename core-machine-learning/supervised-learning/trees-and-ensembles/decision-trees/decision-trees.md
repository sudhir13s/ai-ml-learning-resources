# Decision trees: learning by asking the right questions

A decision tree is the machine-learning version of the game *20 Questions*. To classify something, it asks a series of simple yes/no questions about its features — "is age ≤ 40?", "is income ≤ \$50k?" — and walks down the branches until it reaches a leaf that holds the answer. Each question splits the data into two cleaner groups, and the tree *learns* which questions to ask, and in what order, by greedily picking at every step the split that most reduces **impurity** (how mixed the labels are). The result is a model you can literally read as a flowchart — the most **interpretable** model in mainstream ML — that needs no feature scaling, handles numbers and categories together, and captures non-linear patterns. On its own a single tree is a bit fragile, but it is the fundamental building block of the algorithms that still dominate tabular data: **random forests** and **gradient boosting**.

This page is the definitive treatment. We will build the tree from one idea — *recursive binary splitting* — and **derive** every result rather than state it: why the globally-optimal tree is NP-hard (so we go greedy), what Gini and entropy actually measure and how they differ, the **information-gain** objective derived as parent-minus-weighted-children impurity, regression trees as **variance reduction** (derived), the axis-aligned "staircase" boundary and why a rotation breaks a tree, *why* trees overfit and the exact knobs that stop them (including **cost-complexity pruning**, derived), the **bias–variance** reason a single tree is high-variance and why that *motivates* ensembles, the CART vs ID3/C4.5 lineage, and how **feature importance** is computed (and biased). We work **three** numeric examples of increasing complexity, then — in a companion module and a runnable notebook — **grow a tree from scratch**, prove it matches scikit-learn, and measure the overfitting curve, feature-importance bias, and regression staircase. **Every figure and number on this page comes from an executed run on real scikit-learn datasets** — **Iris** (150 flowers) for the from-scratch tree and the boundary, **Breast Cancer Wisconsin** (569 tumours) for overfitting and importance, and **Diabetes** (442 patients) for the regression staircase — nothing is illustrative-only unless labelled so.

By the end you will be able to:

- explain **recursive binary splitting** and why finding the globally optimal tree is **NP-hard** (so trees are grown greedily);
- compute **Gini impurity** and **entropy**, contrast them, and **derive information gain** as the split objective;
- derive **regression trees** as **variance / MSE reduction**, and explain the leaf-mean prediction;
- explain the axis-aligned **staircase** boundary and why a feature **rotation** changes a tree;
- explain *why* trees overfit and how **max_depth, min_samples_leaf, and cost-complexity pruning** (derived) control it;
- give the **bias–variance** reason a single deep tree is **high-variance**, and why **bagging cuts variance** and **boosting cuts bias**;
- distinguish **CART (Gini)** from **ID3 / C4.5 (entropy, gain ratio)**;
- compute **feature importance** two ways (impurity-decrease and permutation) and explain the **high-cardinality bias**;
- build the splitting logic from scratch and reproduce the overfitting curve in numbers.

Intuition and pictures first, then the math (with sources), then runnable, verified code.

> **Note:** the whole algorithm is one idea applied recursively — *find the single question that best separates the labels, split on it, and repeat on each side until the groups are pure enough.* Everything else (Gini vs entropy, pruning, regression vs classification, feature importance) is a detail of "best separates" or "pure enough." Hold that sentence and the rest of the page hangs off it.

## The problem: a flexible, readable model for tabular data

You want a model that captures non-linear structure, handles **mixed feature types** (age, zip code, blood type) without preprocessing, needs **no normalization**, copes with missing values, and — crucially — that a human can **inspect and trust**. Linear and logistic models give interpretability but only straight boundaries; kernel SVMs and neural nets are flexible but opaque, and they demand scaling and careful tuning. Decision trees hit a sweet spot: arbitrary **axis-aligned** regions, learned greedily from the data, expressed as a flowchart anyone can follow. That readability — you can point at the exact path that produced a decision — is why they remain a default in medicine, credit scoring, fraud, and operations, where a model that *can't* explain itself is often a non-starter.

Make the inadequacy concrete: a **single straight line can't cleanly separate the three Iris species** — no one line puts setosa, versicolor, and virginica each on their own side. But the **axis-aligned staircase** a tree carves — a few horizontal/vertical cuts stacking into rectangles — separates them almost perfectly (you'll see exactly this in [the decision-boundary figure](#what-a-tree-computes-axis-aligned-regions-and-the-staircase) below). That is the felt gap this page fills: from "one boundary isn't enough" to "a stack of one-feature questions is."

> **Tip:** the interview framing is "interpretable, non-parametric, scale-free, mixed-type — but unstable as a single model." Everything good and bad about trees flows from one design choice: they ask **threshold questions on one feature at a time**. That buys interpretability and scale-invariance; it costs you smooth boundaries and stability.

---

## The model: recursive binary splitting

A tree is grown **top-down and greedily**. At the root, the whole dataset sits in one node. The learner considers **every feature and every candidate threshold**, scores each split "feature $j \le t$?" by how much it reduces impurity, picks the single best one, sends the data left (yes) and right (no), and **recurses** on each child — stopping when a node is pure (all one class), too small to split, or a stopping rule fires. Each leaf predicts the **majority class** (classification) or the **mean target** (regression) of the training samples that land in it.

```mermaid

    R -->|"no"| N{"petal width ≤ 1.55 cm?"}:::process

```

That flowchart is not a cartoon — its thresholds (2.45, 1.55) are the **real values the algorithm learns**, though it is a simplified 3-leaf schematic. Here is the actual fitted tree on Iris (`max_depth=3`, Gini), drawn straight from the model with every split threshold, Gini value, and sample count — **this is the full 4-feature Iris tree (test accuracy 0.978); the from-scratch 2-feature slice used in the [code section](#code-a-tree-from-scratch-verified-and-the-overfitting-curve) later reaches 0.933 — same algorithm, fewer features:**

![A learned decision tree on the real Iris dataset (max_depth 3, Gini criterion), test accuracy 0.978. The root splits on 'petal length ≤ 2.45', which sends all 35 setosa training samples into a pure leaf (Gini 0, value [35,0,0]). The right subtree then splits on petal width ≤ 1.55 and further on petal length/width, separating versicolor from virginica down to nearly-pure leaves. Each box shows the split test, the Gini, the sample count, the per-class counts, and the majority class.](../images/sup07_tree_structure.png)

The first split alone — petal length ≤ 2.45 cm — isolates **every** setosa into a pure leaf (Gini 0). That is the greedy algorithm finding, in one question, the feature and threshold that most reduce impurity. To **classify** a new point you walk it down the tree following the answers — $O(\text{depth})$ comparisons, with **no arithmetic on the feature values themselves** beyond comparing each to a threshold (hence no scaling needed; a monotone transform of a feature, like $\log$, leaves every split unchanged). This scale-invariance is the flip side of the [feature-scaling](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/data-preparation/feature-scaling-and-normalization/feature-scaling-and-normalization) story: distance- and gradient-based models *need* scaling; a tree, splitting on thresholds, is immune to it.

**For a numeric feature**, the candidate thresholds are the **midpoints between adjacent sorted values** — between two consecutive distinct values every threshold gives the identical partition, so you only need one per gap. With $n$ samples that's $O(n)$ thresholds per feature, $O(nd)$ candidate splits per node; sorting once dominates the cost. **For a categorical feature**, CART considers subset splits (which categories go left vs right); for a $K$-category feature there are $2^{K-1}-1$ non-trivial binary partitions, so high-cardinality categoricals are expensive (and, as we'll see, a source of bias).

> **Note:** the search is **greedy** — at each node it picks the *locally* best split without looking ahead, then never revisits that choice. It does this because finding the **globally optimal** tree (the one that, over all possible trees of a given size, minimizes error) is **NP-hard** (Hyafil & Rivest, 1976): the number of trees explodes combinatorially with features and thresholds, so exhaustive search is intractable. Greedy is a heuristic that works very well in practice but is *not* guaranteed optimal — it can miss a split that only pays off **after** a later split (an XOR pattern is the classic trap: neither feature alone reduces impurity, so a greedy root split sees no gain, even though two splits together separate the classes perfectly).

> **Gotcha:** "the tree found the best split" almost never means the best *tree*. In an interview, say it precisely: *each node's split is locally optimal under a one-step impurity criterion; the overall tree is a greedy heuristic because the global problem is NP-hard.* That single sentence separates people who memorized "trees are greedy" from people who know *why*.

## How a split is chosen: impurity and information gain

"Best split" means the one that makes the children **purest** — least mixed in their labels. We need a number for "mixed," and there are two standard choices for classification. Writing $p_c$ for the fraction of class $c$ in a node:

$$\text{Gini}(node) = \sum_c p_c(1-p_c) = 1 - \sum_c p_c^2 \qquad \text{Entropy}(node) = -\sum_c p_c \log_2 p_c$$

Both are **0 when a node is pure** (one class has $p=1$, the rest $0$) and **maximal when classes are evenly mixed**. For two classes: Gini peaks at $1-(0.5^2+0.5^2)=0.5$, entropy at $-(0.5\log_2 0.5 + 0.5\log_2 0.5)=1$ bit. Plotting them against the class proportion $p$ shows the shapes are nearly identical — both smooth, both concave — while a third measure, **misclassification error** $1-\max_c p_c$, is only piecewise-linear:

![Three impurity measures for a binary node as the proportion p of one class sweeps from 0 to 1, each point computed by the chapter module's own Gini and entropy functions. Entropy (peak 1.0 bit), Gini = 1 − Σ p² (peak 0.5), and misclassification error 1 − max p (peak 0.5) all reach 0 at the pure ends and maximum at p=0.5. Entropy/2 is overlaid to show its shape almost coincides with Gini. Gini and entropy are smooth and strictly concave; misclassification is piecewise-linear, which makes it a poor split criterion for tree growing.](images/sup07_impurity.png)

A split's quality is its **information gain** — the parent's impurity minus the **weighted average** impurity of the two children, where the weights are the fraction of samples going each way:

$$\text{Gain} = I(\text{parent}) - \underbrace{\left(\frac{n_L}{n}\,I(\text{left}) + \frac{n_R}{n}\,I(\text{right})\right)}_{\text{weighted child impurity}}$$

The tree tries every (feature, threshold) pair and keeps the split with the **highest gain**. Because $I(\text{parent})$ is a constant for the node, **maximizing gain is identical to minimizing the weighted child impurity** — that's the quantity scikit-learn actually compares across candidate splits.

**Why the weighting matters:** without it, you could "improve" a node by carving off a tiny pure sliver and leaving a huge mixed remainder. The $n_L/n$ and $n_R/n$ weights make the objective honest — a child only helps in proportion to how many samples it actually cleans up. When entropy is the impurity, this exact quantity is the classic **information gain** of decision-tree induction; with Gini it's the **Gini gain** (CART). They are the same formula with a different $I$.

**Why not misclassification error as the split criterion?** Because it's insensitive to *within-node* improvements. Suppose a node is 80/20 (error $0.2$) and a split makes one child 100/0 and the other 60/40. Misclassification of the children: $0$ and $0.4$, weighted (say 50/50) $= 0.2$ — **no improvement**, error says don't split. But the split clearly purified one side! Gini and entropy, being strictly concave, **reward that move toward purity**, which is exactly the annotated point in the figure above. Misclassification is fine for **pruning** (where you care about final error) but a poor criterion for **growing**.

> **Note:** **Gini vs entropy** barely changes the resulting tree in practice — they agree on the chosen split the vast majority of the time. Gini is slightly cheaper (no logarithms) and is scikit-learn's **CART** default; entropy is Quinlan's **ID3 / C4.5** choice and has a clean "bits of information" interpretation. Pick Gini for speed, entropy if you want the information-theoretic story; don't agonize over it.

## Regression trees: variance reduction, derived

For **regression** (continuous target $y$), "impurity" becomes **variance** (equivalently, mean squared error). A leaf predicts a single constant $\hat y$; the natural impurity is the within-node MSE around that constant:

$$I(\text{node}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i \in \text{node}} (y_i - \hat y)^2.$$

We can **derive** the best constant. Minimize $\sum_i (y_i - \hat y)^2$ over $\hat y$: take the derivative and set it to zero,

$$\frac{d}{d\hat y}\sum_i (y_i-\hat y)^2 = -2\sum_i(y_i-\hat y) = 0 \;\Longrightarrow\; \hat y = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i y_i.$$

So **the optimal leaf prediction is the mean** of the targets in that leaf, and the resulting minimum impurity is exactly the **variance** $\frac1n\sum_i (y_i-\bar y)^2$. A split is then chosen to minimize the weighted child variance $\frac{n_L}{n}\text{Var}(L) + \frac{n_R}{n}\text{Var}(R)$ — i.e. to **maximize variance reduction**, the regression analogue of information gain. The fitted function is therefore **piecewise-constant**: a staircase of flat segments, one per leaf, each at its interval's mean.

![A regression tree fit to one real feature (bmi) of the scikit-learn Diabetes dataset (442 patients), predicting disease-progression score. The green curve (depth 2, four distinct leaf values) is a coarse piecewise-constant staircase capturing the broad upward trend; the red curve (depth 8, ~90 leaf values) chases the noise with many tiny steps. Each flat segment is one leaf predicting the mean target of the points in its interval; splits are placed to cut within-leaf variance. The deep tree overfits while the shallow tree generalizes.](images/sup07_regression.png)

> **Note:** a regression tree can only output **values it has seen averaged in training** — it is piecewise-constant, so it **cannot extrapolate** beyond the range of the training targets, and it produces visible "steps" rather than a smooth line. That blockiness is exactly what **gradient boosting** smooths out by summing many small trees, and what a forest softens by averaging.

> **Tip:** classification and regression trees are the *same algorithm* with a different impurity: swap Gini/entropy for variance, and majority-vote for mean. If you can explain one, you can explain the other by naming the substitution — a clean thing to say in an interview.

> **Source / derivation:** the regression-tree criterion (minimize within-node sum of squares, leaf = mean) and the growing/pruning algorithm are **CART**, Breiman, Friedman, Olshen & Stone, *Classification and Regression Trees* (1984); the textbook derivations are **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** §8.1.2 (regression trees) and **The Elements of Statistical Learning** §9.2.2. The staircase figure above is produced by `code/decision_trees.py::regression_staircase` on the real scikit-learn Diabetes dataset.

## What a tree computes: axis-aligned regions and the staircase

Because every split is "feature $\le$ threshold," a tree carves the feature space into **axis-aligned hyper-rectangles** (boxes whose faces are perpendicular to the axes), predicting one label or value per box:

![The decision boundary of a from-scratch decision tree (max_depth 4) on the two petal features of the real Iris dataset. The feature space is carved into axis-aligned rectangles — a pale blue setosa region on the left, a purple versicolor band in the middle, and a green virginica region on the right, with a small versicolor notch — separated by purely horizontal and vertical edges, never a diagonal. Real training flowers are plotted on top. The from-scratch tree's boundary matches scikit-learn on 98% of test points.](images/sup07_boundary.png)

The tell-tale **staircase** boundary is a direct consequence of axis-aligned splits — a single tree can only cut **perpendicular to an axis**, so a diagonal or curved boundary is approximated by many little steps, each step a separate split. (The rectangles above are painted by classifying a dense grid with our *own* from-scratch tree, so this is the model's genuine decision surface — see the [code](#code-a-tree-from-scratch-verified-and-the-overfitting-curve).) This has two important consequences:

- **A 45° rotation of the data changes the tree.** Rotate the features and a boundary that *was* axis-aligned (cheap — one split) becomes diagonal (expensive — a staircase of many splits), and vice versa. Trees are **not** rotation-invariant, unlike, say, a linear SVM whose boundary's *shape* is unchanged by rotation. This is also the reason a PCA rotation can sometimes help (or hurt) a tree, and why "oblique" trees that split on linear combinations of features exist.
- **Interactions are captured automatically.** Because a child split happens *within* the region carved by its parent, a tree naturally models "if A and B then…" interactions with no manual feature engineering — a big part of why trees and tree ensembles are so strong on messy tabular data.

> **Gotcha:** "trees need no feature scaling" is true and a common interview point — but be ready for the follow-up: *they are scale-invariant but **not** rotation-invariant.* Monotone per-feature transforms (scaling, $\log$) leave every threshold split unchanged; a rotation that mixes features does not, and can dramatically change the tree's complexity.

---

## Why trees overfit, and how to stop them

Keep splitting and a tree will eventually isolate **every** training point in its own pure leaf — a leaf per sample, zero training error, but it has **memorized the data, including its noise**. Training accuracy hits 100% while test accuracy peaks early and then *falls*:

![Training and validation accuracy as tree depth increases on the real Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (398 training tumours). Training accuracy climbs steadily to 1.000 by depth 6, but validation accuracy peaks at 0.930 at depth 5 and then flattens/declines to ~0.918 — the growing gap between the two curves is overfitting. A dashed line marks the best-validation depth (5) and a shaded region marks the overfitting zone past it.](images/sup07_overfit.png)

The cure is to **limit complexity** — pre-pruning (stop early) or post-pruning (grow full, then cut back):

- **`max_depth`** — cap how deep the tree may grow. The most direct complexity knob.
- **`min_samples_leaf` / `min_samples_split`** — require a minimum number of samples to *be* a leaf or to *make* a split, so the tree can't split down to single noisy points.
- **`max_leaf_nodes` / `min_impurity_decrease`** — cap the number of leaves, or refuse splits whose gain is below a threshold (don't split for a trivial improvement).
- **Cost-complexity (weakest-link) pruning** — grow a full tree, then prune back the subtrees that don't earn their keep, chosen by cross-validation. This is CART's principled post-pruning; we derive it next.

### Cost-complexity pruning, derived

Pre-pruning is greedy and can stop too early (it can't see a good split hiding *behind* a weak one). **Cost-complexity pruning** avoids that by growing the full tree $T_0$ first, then defining, for any subtree $T$, a penalized cost that trades training error against the **number of leaves** $|\widetilde T|$:

$$R_\alpha(T) = R(T) + \alpha\,|\widetilde T|,$$

where $R(T)$ is the tree's training error (misclassification rate, or total leaf impurity) and $\alpha \ge 0$ is a **complexity penalty per leaf**. At $\alpha = 0$ the full tree wins (lowest training error). As $\alpha$ grows, each leaf must "pay rent" $\alpha$, so over-elaborate subtrees become net-negative and get collapsed. The elegant result (Breiman et al.) is that as $\alpha$ increases continuously from $0$ to $\infty$, you get a **finite, nested sequence of optimal subtrees** $T_0 \supset T_1 \supset \dots \supset \{\text{root}\}$ — each step prunes the "weakest link," the internal node whose subtree gives the smallest error increase per leaf removed. You then pick the $\alpha$ (hence the subtree) with the best **cross-validated** error. In scikit-learn this is the `ccp_alpha` hyperparameter, and `cost_complexity_pruning_path` returns the sequence of $\alpha$ breakpoints.

> **Note:** the per-leaf penalty $\alpha$ is the tree analogue of $\lambda$ in ridge/lasso regularization: it buys lower variance at the cost of a little bias. $\alpha = 0$ → full, high-variance tree; large $\alpha$ → a stump that's all bias. Cross-validation finds the sweet spot — the same sweet spot the overfitting figure shows as the peak of the test curve.

> **Source / derivation:** cost-complexity (weakest-link) pruning and the theorem that varying $\alpha$ yields a finite nested sequence of optimal subtrees are Chapter 3 of **CART** (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen & Stone, 1984); the compact textbook version is **The Elements of Statistical Learning** §9.2.2 ("Cost-Complexity Pruning") and **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** §8.1.1. scikit-learn exposes it as `ccp_alpha` / `cost_complexity_pruning_path`.

> **Gotcha:** a single overgrown tree pruned by CV is *better* than an arbitrary `max_depth`, but it's still **one tree** — high-variance by nature. Pruning controls overfitting; it does **not** make a single tree stable. For stability you ensemble (next section). Don't oversell pruning as the fix for variance.

---

## The bias–variance reason ensembles exist

A single decision tree is the textbook **low-bias, high-variance** model. Grown deep, it can fit almost any training set arbitrarily well (**low bias** — it's flexible enough to carve out any region). But it is **unstable**: change a handful of training points and the greedy root split can flip to a different feature, and because every descendant split is conditioned on its ancestors, **that one change cascades into a completely different tree** (**high variance**). Two bootstrap samples of the same data can produce trees that look nothing alike yet both fit well — that instability *is* the variance.

That high variance is exactly what ensembles attack, in two complementary ways:

- **Bagging / Random Forests cut variance.** [Bagging](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/trees-and-ensembles/bagging/bagging) trains many deep trees on **bootstrap resamples** and **averages** them; averaging $B$ roughly-independent estimators divides variance by up to $B$. [Random forests](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/trees-and-ensembles/random-forests/random-forests) go further by also sampling a random subset of features at each split, **de-correlating** the trees so the averaging is more effective. Each tree stays low-bias; the ensemble's variance collapses.
- **Boosting cuts bias.** [Gradient boosting](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/trees-and-ensembles/gradient-boosting-xgboost/gradient-boosting-xgboost) does the opposite: it adds many **shallow** (high-bias, low-variance) trees **sequentially**, each correcting the residual errors of the running sum. Stacking weak learners drives bias down while keeping variance controlled.

Decision trees are the base learner of choice *precisely because* they're flexible but high-variance — they give the ensemble something to tame. (See [Bias–Variance Tradeoff](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/model-selection-and-evaluation/bias-variance-tradeoff/bias-variance-tradeoff) for the decomposition.)

The interview-grade continuation: *that's exactly why **random forests** (bagging → ↓variance) and **gradient boosting** (→ ↓bias) exist — they're built on trees specifically to fix the single tree's weakness.* The whole tree-ensemble family is one answer to "the single tree has too much variance."

## CART vs ID3 / C4.5: the family tree of trees

"Decision tree" names a family with a few distinct algorithms; interviewers like to check you know which is which:

- **ID3** (Quinlan, 1986) — the original. Splits on **information gain (entropy)**, handles only **categorical** features, makes a **multi-way** split (one branch per category value), and does no pruning. Simple and historically important, but it **favors high-cardinality features** (more values → more apparent gain) and overfits.
- **C4.5** (Quinlan, 1993) — ID3's successor. Uses **gain ratio** (information gain normalized by the split's own entropy) to fix the high-cardinality bias, handles **continuous** features via thresholds and **missing values**, and adds **post-pruning**. The workhorse of 1990s symbolic ML.
- **CART** (Breiman et al., 1984) — uses **Gini** (classification) or **variance** (regression), always makes **binary** splits, and prunes with **cost-complexity**. It does both classification *and* regression, which is why it's the basis of essentially every modern implementation, **including scikit-learn**.

> **Note:** when you use `DecisionTreeClassifier` or `DecisionTreeRegressor` in scikit-learn, you are using a **CART** variant — **binary** splits, **Gini** by default (or entropy if you ask), cost-complexity pruning via `ccp_alpha`. ID3/C4.5's multi-way splits and gain ratio are not in scikit-learn; if someone says "the tree split into three branches," they're describing ID3/C4.5, not CART.

> **Source / derivation:** **ID3** — Quinlan, "Induction of Decision Trees," *Machine Learning* 1(1), 1986; **C4.5** — Quinlan, *C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning*, 1993 (gain ratio, continuous features, pruning); **CART** — Breiman, Friedman, Olshen & Stone, *Classification and Regression Trees*, 1984 (binary splits, Gini/variance, cost-complexity pruning) — the basis of scikit-learn's trees. The greedy heuristic is forced by the hardness result **Hyafil & Rivest (1976)**, "Constructing Optimal Binary Decision Trees is NP-complete." All four are linked in the [references](decision-trees.references.md).

---

## Categorical features and missing values

Two practical wrinkles that interviewers probe and that bite in practice.

**Categorical features.** A native CART finds the best **subset** split — which categories go left vs right — by trying partitions of the $K$ values. For an *unordered* $K$-category feature there are $2^{K-1}-1$ candidate binary splits, which is exponential, so high-cardinality categoricals are both expensive and prone to overfit (each rare category can be carved into its own branch). A useful shortcut: for a *binary* target, sort the categories by their **mean target value** and treat them as ordered — Fisher (1958) proved this reduces the search from exponential to **linear** while still finding the optimal split. **scikit-learn's trees do not accept raw strings**: you must encode first. **One-hot encoding** is safe but explodes a high-cardinality feature into many sparse columns (and biases splits toward it); **ordinal / target encoding** keeps it compact but imposes an order. LightGBM and CatBoost handle categoricals natively and are usually the better choice when you have many high-cardinality ones.

**Missing values.** A tree must still route a sample with a missing split-feature down *some* branch. Classic strategies: **surrogate splits** (CART) — at each node, learn a backup feature that best mimics the primary split, and use it when the primary is missing; or simply **send missing to whichever child reduces impurity more** (the LightGBM/XGBoost default, learned per split). Because the model decides routing *per node*, trees tolerate missingness far more gracefully than linear models, which need imputation up front. scikit-learn's `DecisionTree*` added native NaN handling (it routes missing to the better side) — but historically you imputed first.

> **Gotcha:** one-hot encoding a high-cardinality categorical for a tree is a quiet performance killer — it both **fragments** the feature into many weak binary columns (so the tree can't see the category as a whole) and **biases** MDI importance toward the resulting many columns. For trees specifically, prefer native categorical handling (LightGBM/CatBoost) or target encoding over naive one-hot.

## Feature importance — and its high-cardinality bias

A big selling point of trees is telling you **which features mattered**. There are two ways to measure it, and they disagree in an important way.

**Mean decrease in impurity (MDI / "Gini importance").** For each feature, sum the impurity decrease (weighted by samples reaching the node) over **every split that used that feature**, across the tree (or the forest), then normalize. It's free — computed during training — and is scikit-learn's `feature_importances_`. Its flaw: it is **biased toward high-cardinality features** (many unique values: continuous features, IDs, zip codes). Such features offer **more candidate thresholds**, so by sheer chance one of them often yields a small spurious impurity decrease, inflating their importance — even a **random unique ID** can look important under MDI.

**Permutation importance.** Train the model, measure validation accuracy, then **shuffle one feature's column** and measure how much accuracy drops; the drop is that feature's importance. It's **model-agnostic**, measures importance on **held-out** data, and **doesn't suffer the cardinality bias** (a useless ID column, when shuffled, changes nothing, so it correctly scores ~0). The cost is that it requires extra passes over the data and is sensitive to **correlated features** (shuffling one of two correlated features barely hurts, so both can look unimportant).

![Two panels of measured feature importance. Left: mean-decrease-in-impurity (MDI) importances on the real Breast Cancer dataset — 'worst radius' dominates at 0.727, followed by 'worst concave points' 0.131 and 'worst texture' 0.050. Right: the high-cardinality trap. On a controlled experiment with one weak-but-real binary signal and one pure-noise near-unique column ('random_id'), MDI ranks the noise column at 0.82 — far above the real signal's 0.18 — because its many distinct values offer more thresholds to luck into a spurious split, while permutation importance measured on held-out data correctly scores the noise at ≈0 (−0.01) and the signal at 0.10.](images/sup07_importance.png)

The right panel is the trap in real numbers: **MDI ranks a pure-noise column above a genuine signal**, purely because the noise column has more distinct values (hence more candidate thresholds). Permutation importance, measured on held-out data, is not fooled.

> **Gotcha:** never trust raw MDI / `feature_importances_` for a feature-selection or "what drives the model" claim when you have high-cardinality features (IDs, timestamps, free-text categories). It will rank a meaningless unique key near the top. Use **permutation importance** (or SHAP) on a **held-out** set instead — this is a favorite "gotcha" interview question and a real-world footgun.

## Strengths and weaknesses

- **Strengths:** **interpretable** — a readable flowchart with an explicit decision path; **no feature scaling** (scale-invariant); handles **numeric + categorical** features and (in some implementations) **missing values**; captures **non-linearities and interactions** automatically; **fast to predict** ($O(\text{depth})$); gives free **feature importances**.
- **Weaknesses:** **high variance / unstable** as a single model; **greedy** (no lookahead, can miss XOR-style structure); **axis-aligned only** (struggles with diagonal boundaries; not rotation-invariant); **biased toward high-cardinality features** in both splitting and MDI importance; **prone to overfit** without depth control or pruning; can be **biased on imbalanced classes** (use class weights); regression trees **can't extrapolate** (piecewise-constant).

## Worked example 1 (minimal): the Gini of a 50/50 node

Start with the simplest possible node: 10 samples, 5 of class 0 and 5 of class 1 — maximally mixed. With $p_0 = p_1 = 0.5$:

$$\text{Gini} = 1 - (p_0^2 + p_1^2) = 1 - (0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = 1 - 0.5 = \mathbf{0.5}.$$

Entropy on the same node: $-(0.5\log_2 0.5 + 0.5\log_2 0.5) = -(0.5\cdot(-1) + 0.5\cdot(-1)) = \mathbf{1\ \text{bit}}$. Both are at their **maximum** — a 50/50 binary node is the most impure a node can be, and matches the peak of the impurity figure at $p=0.5$. A pure node (10/0) would give Gini $= 1 - (1^2 + 0^2) = 0$ and entropy $= -(1\log_2 1 + 0) = 0$. This is the anchor for everything: splits try to move nodes **from 0.5 toward 0**.

---

## Worked example 2 (realistic): a full information-gain split

Now do a real split end to end. A parent node has **14 samples: 9 class-1 ("yes"), 5 class-0 ("no")** — the classic "play tennis" setup. Parent impurity:

$$p_1 = \tfrac{9}{14} \approx 0.643,\quad p_0 = \tfrac{5}{14} \approx 0.357,\qquad \text{Gini}_{\text{parent}} = 1 - (0.643^2 + 0.357^2) = 1 - (0.413 + 0.128) = \mathbf{0.459}.$$

A candidate split on "outlook" sends the data into two children:

- **Left child** ($n_L = 8$): 6 class-1, 2 class-0. $\;\text{Gini}_L = 1 - \big((6/8)^2 + (2/8)^2\big) = 1 - (0.5625 + 0.0625) = 0.375$.
- **Right child** ($n_R = 6$): 3 class-1, 3 class-0 (a 50/50 node). $\;\text{Gini}_R = 1 - (0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = 0.5$.

Weighted child impurity (the quantity the tree actually minimizes):

$$\frac{n_L}{n}\text{Gini}_L + \frac{n_R}{n}\text{Gini}_R = \frac{8}{14}(0.375) + \frac{6}{14}(0.5) = 0.2143 + 0.2143 = \mathbf{0.4286}.$$

Information (Gini) gain:

$$\text{Gain} = \text{Gini}_{\text{parent}} - 0.4286 = 0.459 - 0.4286 = \mathbf{0.031}.$$

A small positive gain — this split helps a little (it purified the left child) but leaves a 50/50 mess on the right. The tree would compare this **0.031** against the gain of every other feature and threshold and keep the largest. **Contrast with a perfect split:** if some threshold sent all 9 class-1 left and all 5 class-0 right, both children would be pure (Gini 0), weighted child impurity $= 0$, and gain $= 0.459 - 0 = 0.459$ — the **maximum possible** (the full parent impurity), and the tree would obviously prefer it.

> **Note:** the gain can never exceed the parent's impurity (the best you can do is drive the children to 0), and a **useless** split — one where each child has the *same* class proportions as the parent — yields gain exactly **0**. That zero is why a tree won't split on a feature that carries no information about the label.

## Worked example 3 (full trace): a regression variance-reduction split

Now the regression analogue, traced fully. Six points with targets $y = [1, 1, 2, 8, 9, 9]$ at sorted feature values $x = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]$. The parent leaf would predict the mean $\bar y = \frac{1+1+2+8+9+9}{6} = 5$, with variance

$$\text{Var}_{\text{parent}} = \tfrac16\big[(1-5)^2 + (1-5)^2 + (2-5)^2 + (8-5)^2 + (9-5)^2 + (9-5)^2\big] = \tfrac16[16+16+9+9+16+16] = \tfrac{82}{6} = \mathbf{13.67}.$$

Try the split **$x \le 4.5$** (the natural gap between $x=3$ and $x=6$):

- **Left** ($y = [1,1,2]$, $n_L=3$): mean $= \tfrac{4}{3} = 1.333$. $\;\text{Var}_L = \tfrac13[(1-1.333)^2 + (1-1.333)^2 + (2-1.333)^2] = \tfrac13[0.111+0.111+0.444] = 0.222$.
- **Right** ($y = [8,9,9]$, $n_R=3$): mean $= \tfrac{26}{3} = 8.667$. $\;\text{Var}_R = \tfrac13[(8-8.667)^2 + (9-8.667)^2 + (9-8.667)^2] = \tfrac13[0.444+0.111+0.111] = 0.222$.

Weighted child variance:

$$\frac{3}{6}(0.222) + \frac{3}{6}(0.222) = \mathbf{0.222}.$$

Variance reduction (the regression "gain"):

$$\Delta = \text{Var}_{\text{parent}} - 0.222 = 13.67 - 0.222 = \mathbf{13.44}.$$

A massive reduction — this split cleanly separates the low group ($\approx 1.3$) from the high group ($\approx 8.7$), and each leaf predicts its own mean. Any other threshold (say $x \le 2.5$, splitting $[1,1]$ from $[2,8,9,9]$) leaves a high-variance right child and a smaller $\Delta$, so the tree picks $x \le 4.5$. This is variance reduction doing exactly what information gain does for classification — and the leaf predictions $1.333$ and $8.667$ are the two flat steps of the regression staircase.

> **Tip:** the three examples are the whole arc in miniature: **(1)** measure impurity of one node (Gini of 50/50 = 0.5), **(2)** score a classification split (parent − weighted children = information gain), **(3)** score a regression split (parent − weighted children = variance reduction). Same template three times; only the impurity changes.

## Code: a tree from scratch, verified, and the overfitting curve

Everything on this page is backed by a small, real, runnable codebase — no synthetic toy data:

- **`code/decision_trees.py`** — the chapter module. Gini/entropy, the greedy best-split search, a full **`DecisionTreeScratch`** (recursive `fit`/`predict` with a `max_depth` stop), the scikit-learn verification, the Breast-Cancer depth sweep, the feature-importance/MDI-bias experiment, and the diabetes regression staircase. Run `python decision_trees.py` for the printed proof.
- **`code/07-Decision-Trees.ipynb`** — the same material as a 13-step, run-live notebook: impurity → information gain → best split → grow from scratch → verify → plot the tree → the boundary → the depth sweep → importance → the MDI trap → regression.

The whole splitting engine is short enough to read. This is the actual code the figures use:

```python
def gini(y):                        # 1 - sum_c p_c^2  (0 = pure, 0.5 = 50/50 for 2 classes)
    if y.size == 0:
        return 0.0
    p = np.bincount(y) / y.size
    return float(1.0 - np.sum(p**2))

def information_gain(y, mask, criterion="gini"):   # parent - weighted children
    impurity = gini if criterion == "gini" else entropy
    y_left, y_right = y[mask], y[~mask]
    if y_left.size == 0 or y_right.size == 0:
        return 0.0                  # a split that separates nothing has no gain
    w_left, w_right = y_left.size / y.size, y_right.size / y.size
    return impurity(y) - (w_left * impurity(y_left) + w_right * impurity(y_right))

def best_split(x, y, criterion="gini"):            # greedy search over features x thresholds
    best = Split(feature=-1, threshold=0.0, gain=0.0)
    for feature in range(x.shape[1]):
        column = x[:, feature]
        for threshold in _candidate_thresholds(column):   # midpoints between sorted values
            gain = information_gain(y, column <= threshold, criterion)
            if gain > best.gain:
                best = Split(feature, float(threshold), gain)
    return best if best.feature >= 0 else None
```

`DecisionTreeScratch.fit` just calls `best_split`, partitions the rows, and recurses on each side until a node is pure, too small, or at `max_depth`. Running the module prints, in order: the impurity anchors, the from-scratch tree, the scikit-learn verification, the depth sweep, the importances, and the regression staircase. The load-bearing parts of that output:

```
=== 0. Impurity anchors (the worked-example numbers, computed) ===
  50/50 node : Gini=0.500  entropy=1.000 bits  (max impurity)
  pure node  : Gini=0.000  entropy=0.000 bits  (zero impurity)
  worked ex.2: parent Gini=0.459 -> split (6/2)&(3/3) -> Gini gain=0.031

=== 1. A decision tree grown FROM SCRATCH on Iris (petal length, petal width) (max_depth=3) ===
petal length (cm) <= 2.450?  (gini=0.667, n=105)
    ├─ yes: predict 'setosa'  (n=35, gini=0.000)
    └─ no:  petal width (cm) <= 1.550?  (gini=0.500, n=70)
        ├─ yes: petal length (cm) <= 4.950?  (gini=0.057, n=34)  ...
        └─ no:  petal length (cm) <= 4.850?  (gini=0.105, n=36)  ...
  leaves=5  train_acc=0.981  test_acc=0.933

=== 2. Verify: from-scratch tree == scikit-learn (same Gini, same max_depth) ===
  from-scratch test accuracy : 0.933
  scikit-learn test accuracy : 0.933
  they agree on 100.0% of test predictions

=== 3. The overfitting curve on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (depth sweep) ===
   depth   train acc   val acc
       1       0.927     0.912
       2       0.965     0.918
       3       0.980     0.924
       5       0.995     0.930   <- best val
       6       1.000     0.918
      20       1.000     0.918
  best validation accuracy 0.930 at max_depth=5; deepest tree memorizes train to 1.000
```

> **Note:** the from-scratch numbers match the derivations exactly — the 50/50 node gives Gini **0.500** / entropy **1.000 bit**, and **Worked Example 2 reproduces the 0.459 → weighted 0.4286 → gain 0.031** split by hand. The from-scratch tree reaches the **same 0.933 test accuracy** as scikit-learn and agrees with it on **100%** of test predictions on this split — the proof that the greedy growing algorithm above *is* CART, not a lookalike. (We check accuracy + prediction agreement rather than demanding an identical tree, because when two candidate splits tie on gain, CART implementations break the tie by their own rule — a different-but-equally-good tree is legitimate.) And the depth sweep is the [overfitting figure](#why-trees-overfit-and-how-to-stop-them) in numbers: training accuracy climbs to a **perfect 1.000** while validation **peaks at 0.930 (depth 5)** and then plateaus lower. Limiting depth is the single knob standing between you and that 1.000 / 0.918 gap.

### The importance bias, measured

The MDI high-cardinality trap is not hypothetical. On a controlled experiment — one weak-but-**real** binary signal and one **pure-noise, near-unique** column — the module measures:

```
=== 4. Feature importance on Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and the MDI high-cardinality trap ===
  the trap (weak real signal vs a pure-noise near-unique column):
     MDI         : signal=0.176   random_id=0.824  <- noise ranked HIGHER
     permutation : signal=0.096   random_id=-0.006  <- noise correctly ~0
```

> **Note:** **MDI ranks the pure-noise `random_id` at 0.824** — far above the real signal's 0.176 — purely because its many distinct values offer more thresholds to luck into a spurious impurity decrease, while **permutation importance** (measured on held-out data) correctly pins it at ≈0 (−0.006). If you ever feature-select from `feature_importances_` with high-cardinality features present, this is why you can be badly misled — use permutation importance or SHAP on a held-out set instead.

---

## Where decision trees are used

- **The base learner for ensembles** — random forests and gradient boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost) are *the* go-to for tabular data and dominate Kaggle. You almost never deploy a lone tree, but it's the atom they're built from.
- **Interpretable / regulated decisions** — credit approval, medical triage, eligibility and fraud rules, where a readable decision path is legally or operationally required. A shallow tree *is* the documentation.
- **Feature exploration** — a shallow tree quickly surfaces the most informative features and their interactions, a fast first look at a new dataset.
- **Rule extraction** — converting a fitted tree into human-readable if-then rules for a rules engine or a domain expert to review.

> **Tip:** the interview arc is almost always: **split criterion (Gini/entropy/info-gain) → overfitting & pruning → "so why a forest?" (variance) → boosting (bias) → feature-importance gotcha.** Knowing *why* a single tree is high-variance, and that ensembles exist to fix exactly that, is what they're checking. Trees are rarely the destination; they're the on-ramp to the ensemble questions.

---

## Pitfalls that actually bite

- **Deploying a single unpruned tree** → it overfits and is high-variance. Always either prune (`ccp_alpha` by CV) / cap depth, or — far better — use a **forest / boosting** ensemble.
- **Trusting `feature_importances_` (MDI)** with high-cardinality features → it inflates noisy many-valued columns (a random ID can top the chart). Use **permutation importance** or SHAP on a **held-out** set.
- **Expecting a regression tree to extrapolate** → it's piecewise-constant and clamps to the training range; it cannot predict above/below values it saw. Use a boosted model or a different family if extrapolation matters.
- **Assuming rotation-invariance** → trees are scale-invariant but **not** rotation-invariant; a diagonal boundary becomes an expensive staircase. Consider feature engineering (e.g. a sum/ratio) for known diagonal structure.
- **Ignoring class imbalance** → the majority class can dominate the impurity criterion; set `class_weight="balanced"` (or resample) so minority splits are valued.
- **Reading too much into one tree's structure** → because trees are unstable, a "the model says feature X is the root cause" story can flip on a slightly different sample. Aggregate importances over a forest, and validate stability.

---

## Recap and rapid-fire

**If you remember nothing else:** a decision tree **recursively splits** the feature space with axis-aligned "feature ≤ t?" questions, **greedily** choosing each split to maximize **information gain** = parent impurity − weighted child impurity (**Gini/entropy** for classification, **variance** for regression). The globally-optimal tree is **NP-hard**, so growth is greedy. The boundary is an axis-aligned **staircase** (scale-invariant but *not* rotation-invariant). A single deep tree is **low-bias / high-variance** and **overfits**, controlled by depth, min-samples, and **cost-complexity pruning** — and that high variance is exactly why **random forests** (↓variance via de-correlated averaging) and **boosting** (↓bias via stacked weak learners) ensemble trees.

**Quick-fire — say these out loud:**

- *How does a tree choose a split?* The feature/threshold with the highest **information gain** = parent impurity − weighted child impurity (largest impurity reduction).
- *Gini vs entropy?* Both measure impurity (0 = pure, max at 50/50); Gini = $1-\sum p_c^2$ (cheaper, CART default), entropy = $-\sum p_c\log_2 p_c$ (ID3/C4.5); results nearly identical.
- *Why not misclassification error to grow?* It's piecewise-linear and insensitive to within-node purification; Gini/entropy are concave and reward it.
- *Regression trees?* Split to maximize **variance reduction**; each leaf predicts the **mean** (derived by minimizing within-leaf squared error). Piecewise-constant; **can't extrapolate**.
- *Why no feature scaling?* Splits are per-feature threshold comparisons — monotone transforms don't change them. (But trees are **not** rotation-invariant.)
- *Why do trees overfit?* They split until leaves are pure, memorizing noise; control with max_depth / min_samples_leaf / **cost-complexity pruning** ($R_\alpha = R + \alpha|\widetilde T|$).
- *Why is a single tree high-variance?* Greedy splits are unstable — a small data change flips the root and cascades into a different tree.
- *What does the boundary look like?* Axis-aligned rectangles — a "staircase."
- *Is the optimal tree found?* No — greedy, locally-best splits; the global problem is **NP-hard**.
- *CART vs ID3/C4.5?* CART = binary splits, Gini/variance, both tasks, cost-complexity pruning (scikit-learn); ID3/C4.5 = entropy/gain-ratio, multi-way, categorical-first.
- *Feature-importance gotcha?* MDI (`feature_importances_`) is **biased toward high-cardinality** features (even a random ID looks important); use **permutation importance** on held-out data.
- *Why do ensembles use trees?* Trees are flexible but high-variance; **bagging/forests cut variance**, **boosting cuts bias**.
