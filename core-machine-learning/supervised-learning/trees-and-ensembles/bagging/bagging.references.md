# Bagging — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/trees-and-ensembles/bagging/bagging)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Bootstrapping Main Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz0x-8-cgaQ) (**StatQuest**). *The bootstrap — resampling with replacement — that bagging is built on.*
2. **See the aggregation** — watch [Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mg8QD0F1dQ) (**Udacity**). *How many bootstrap models combine into one lower-variance predictor.*
3. **Get the math** — read [ISLR Ch. 8.2.1](https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLR-Seventh-Printing.pdf) + [ESL Ch. 8.7](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). *Why averaging cuts variance ~1/B and out-of-bag error.*
4. **Read the source** — skim [Bagging Predictors](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/bagging.pdf) (**Breiman 1996**). *The paper that named and analyzed bagging.*
5. **Make it concrete** — bag deep trees with [scikit-learn `BaggingClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html); watch variance drop and compare to a single tree and a forest.

**Videos**:
- [Bootstrapping Main Ideas!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz0x-8-cgaQ) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — the bootstrap resampling that bagging is built on, from scratch.
- [Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mg8QD0F1dQ) — **Udacity** — how bootstrap models are aggregated into one lower-variance predictor.
- [Random Forests Part 1 — Building, Using, Evaluating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — bagging in action (forests are bagged trees + feature subsampling).
- [Ensemble Learning: Bagging, Boosting & Stacking in 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLt4a8-316E) — **AssemblyAI** — where bagging sits among the three ensemble families.

**Interactive & visual**:
- [MLU-Explain: Random Forest](https://mlu-explain.github.io/random-forest/) — **Amazon** — interactive: see bootstrap samples and aggregation reduce variance (bagging is the engine inside).

**Courses (free)**:
- [Google ML Crash Course — Decision Forests](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/decision-forests) — **Google** — free mini-course: trees → bagging → forests → boosting.
- [CS229: Machine Learning — Lecture notes (Ensembles)](https://cs229.stanford.edu/main_notes.pdf) — **Stanford (Ng)** — bagging and the bias–variance decomposition, rigorously.
