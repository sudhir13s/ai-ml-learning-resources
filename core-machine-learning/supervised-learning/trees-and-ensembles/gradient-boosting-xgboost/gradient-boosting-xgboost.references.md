# Gradient Boosting — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Gradient Boosting (XGBoost · LightGBM · CatBoost)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/trees-and-ensembles/gradient-boosting-xgboost/gradient-boosting-xgboost)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Gradient Boost Part 1: Regression Main Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CC4N4z3GJc) (**StatQuest**). *Trees fitting residuals one after another — the whole idea.*
2. **See why it works** — read [How to explain gradient boosting](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/) (**Parr & Howard**). *The "gradient descent in function space" view, with pictures.*
3. **Get the math** — watch [Gradient Boost Part 2: Regression Details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xudPOBz-vs) (**StatQuest**) + read [ESL Ch. 10](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). *Pseudo-residuals, the additive model, shrinkage.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Friedman: Greedy Function Approximation](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-29/issue-5/Greedy-function-approximation-A-gradient-boosting-machine/10.1214/aos/1013203451.full) → [XGBoost paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754). *The original algorithm, then XGBoost's 2nd-order objective + regularization.*
5. **Make it concrete** — read the [XGBoost "Introduction to Boosted Trees"](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/model.html) tutorial and tune a model on [Kaggle's Intermediate ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning).
