# Logistic Regression — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Logistic Regression](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/classification/logistic-regression/logistic-regression)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Logistic Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8) (**StatQuest**), then play with [MLU-Explain: Logistic Regression](https://mlu-explain.github.io/logistic-regression/). *See the S-curve, the probability, and the boundary before the math.*
2. **See the coefficients** — watch [Logistic Regression Details Pt 1: Coefficients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5cNN2-HWE) (**StatQuest**). *Coefficients are log-odds — the interview follow-up that trips people up.*
3. **Get the math** — read [SLP3 Ch. 5](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/5.pdf) + [CS229 notes §1.2](https://cs229.stanford.edu/main_notes.pdf). *Derive cross-entropy from MLE and show its gradient is (p − y)·x.*
4. **See how it's optimized** — watch [Gradient Descent, Step-by-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDv4f4s2SB8) (**StatQuest**). *Log-loss is convex, so gradient descent reliably finds the optimum.*
5. **Make it concrete** — code the sigmoid, log-loss, and its gradient, or use [scikit-learn `LogisticRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression).

**Videos**:
- [StatQuest: Logistic Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — the gentle, from-scratch intuition for the S-curve and odds.
- [Logistic Regression Details Pt 1: Coefficients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5cNN2-HWE) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — coefficients as log-odds, the classic interview follow-up.
- [Gradient Descent, Step-by-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDv4f4s2SB8) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — how the convex log-loss is actually minimized.
- [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w) — **3Blue1Brown** — why logistic regression is one neuron with a sigmoid.

**Interactive & visual**:
- [MLU-Explain: Logistic Regression](https://mlu-explain.github.io/logistic-regression/) — **Amazon (Jared Wilber)** — fully interactive: move the boundary and watch probabilities and log-loss respond.

**Courses (free)**:
- [Machine Learning Specialization — Course 1 (Classification)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) — **Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI)** — the canonical intro to logistic regression, sigmoid, and log-loss; free to audit.
- [CS229: Machine Learning — Lecture notes §1.2 (Classification)](https://cs229.stanford.edu/main_notes.pdf) — **Stanford (Ng)** — the rigorous MLE derivation and the GLM view in a few pages.
- [Google ML Crash Course — Logistic Regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/logistic-regression) — **Google** — short, applied, with log-loss and calibration interactives.

**Articles / blogs (free, no paywall)**:
- [Logistic Regression](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/logistic-regression/) — **Jeremy Jordan** — a clear, free walkthrough of the model, loss, and gradient.
- [Logistic regression (scikit-learn user guide)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) — **scikit-learn** — the practical reference: solvers, regularization (L1/L2/elastic-net), multiclass.
- [Probability calibration (scikit-learn user guide)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html) — **scikit-learn** — why logistic regression is well-calibrated, reliability diagrams, and `CalibratedClassifierCV` (Platt/isotonic) when it isn't.
