# Support Vector Machines — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Support Vector Machines](support-vector-machines.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [SVM Main Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efR1C6CvhmE) (**StatQuest**). *See the maximum-margin "street" and the support vectors that define it.*
2. **See the kernel trick** — watch [Polynomial Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Toet3EiSFcM) then [RBF Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc5IyLW_hns) (**StatQuest**). *How a kernel computes high-dim dot products without leaving the original space.*
3. **Get the math** — read [ISLR Ch. 9](https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLR-Seventh-Printing.pdf) + the [SVM tutorial](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/cs4701/documents/jason_svm_tutorial.pdf). *Margin objective, soft-margin slack, and the dual that exposes the kernel.*
4. **Read the source** — skim [Support-Vector Networks](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00994018.pdf) (**Cortes & Vapnik 1995**). *The paper that introduced soft-margin SVMs.*
5. **Make it concrete** — fit `SVC` with [scikit-learn SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html); sweep `C` and RBF `gamma`.

**Videos**:
- [Support Vector Machines, Clearly Explained!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efR1C6CvhmE) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — the gentle, from-scratch intuition for margins and support vectors.
- [SVMs Part 2: The Polynomial Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Toet3EiSFcM) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — how the polynomial kernel builds non-linear boundaries.
- [SVMs Part 3: The Radial (RBF) Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc5IyLW_hns) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — the most-used kernel, and what `gamma` controls.
- [Support Vector Machines — The Math You Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VABNfa1ds) — **CodeEmporium** — the optimization view: margin objective, Lagrangian, and the dual.

**Interactive & visual**:
- [RBF SVM parameters — visual sweep](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_rbf_parameters.html) — **scikit-learn** — a grid of `C` × `gamma` showing the boundary go from underfit (too smooth) to overfit (too wiggly).
