# Naive Bayes — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Naive Bayes](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/classification/naive-bayes/naive-bayes)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Naive Bayes, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA) (**StatQuest**). *The spam-filter example: per-word probabilities multiplied into a class score.*
2. **See the continuous case** — watch [Gaussian Naive Bayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3EjCKtlVog) (**StatQuest**). *Handling continuous features by assuming a Gaussian per class.*
3. **Get the math** — read [SLP3 Ch. 4](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf). *The bag-of-words model, MLE counts, log-space, and Laplace smoothing.*
4. **Understand why it works** — skim [Domingos & Pazzani (1997)](https://gwern.net/doc/ai/1997-domingos.pdf) and [Ng & Jordan (2002)](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-discriminativegenerative.pdf). *Why the independence assumption can be violated yet classification stays accurate, and the NB-vs-logistic-regression tradeoff.*
5. **Make it concrete** — build a text classifier with [scikit-learn Naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html); tune `alpha`, compare to logistic regression.
