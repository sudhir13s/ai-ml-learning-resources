# k-Nearest Neighbors — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[k-Nearest Neighbors](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/supervised-learning/classification/k-nearest-neighbors/k-nearest-neighbors)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. All links verified (HTTP 200).

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the intuition** — watch [StatQuest: K-nearest neighbors, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVXime0nQeI) (**Josh Starmer**). *See the neighbor vote decide the label — the whole algorithm in one short video.*
2. **See why k is a knob** — watch [StatQuest: Bias and Variance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBBz3bI-aA) (**Josh Starmer**). *Why small k is high-variance and large k is high-bias — the core of choosing k.*
3. **Get the math** — read [ISLR Ch. 2.2.3 & 3.5 (KNN)](https://www.statlearning.com/) (**James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani**). *k-NN as the running example for the Bayes boundary and bias–variance.*
4. **Understand the failure mode** — read [ESL Ch. 13.3 & 2.5 (curse of dimensionality)](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) (**Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman**). *Why distance-based methods degrade as dimensions grow.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work through the [scikit-learn Nearest Neighbors guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) (**scikit-learn**). *Distance metrics, KD-tree/ball-tree, weighting, and tuning k in code.*

- The knob k turns: [Bias–Variance Tradeoff](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/model-selection-and-evaluation/bias-variance-tradeoff/bias-variance-tradeoff) — small k = high variance, large k = high bias, made precise.
- How you actually pick k: [Cross-Validation](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/model-selection-and-evaluation/cross-validation/cross-validation) — never tune k on training error.
- Why scaling is mandatory: [2. Data Preprocessing](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/data-preparation/readme) — k-NN is acutely sensitive to feature scaling and encoding.
