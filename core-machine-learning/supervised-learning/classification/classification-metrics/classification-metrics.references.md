# Classification Metrics — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Classification Metrics](classification-metrics.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [The Confusion Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdsp6soqA7o) (**StatQuest**), then play with [MLU-Explain: Precision & Recall](https://mlu-explain.github.io/precision-recall/). *Everything else is derived from these four cells.*
2. **See the tradeoff** — watch [Sensitivity and Specificity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP06aMoz4v8) (**StatQuest**). *Why moving the threshold trades recall for specificity.*
3. **Master ROC/AUC** — watch [ROC and AUC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jRBRDbJemM) (**StatQuest**), then explore [MLU-Explain: ROC & AUC](https://mlu-explain.github.io/roc-auc/). *The threshold-free ranking view; when PR-AUC beats ROC-AUC.*
4. **Get the math** — read [scikit-learn: Classification metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics) + [ISLR Ch. 4.4.2](https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLR-Seventh-Printing.pdf). *Exact formulas, multiclass averaging, and the curves.*
5. **Go one level deeper** — read [Davis & Goadrich (2006)](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~page/rocpr.pdf) on PR-vs-ROC under imbalance, then skim [Guo et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599) for why discrimination ≠ calibration. *The two ideas that separate a strong answer from a textbook one.*
6. **Make it concrete** — compute `classification_report`, `average_precision_score`, and `calibration_curve` on an imbalanced dataset; watch accuracy stay high while recall and precision collapse.
