# DBSCAN — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[DBSCAN](dbscan.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author (Ester, Sander, Kriegel, Campello, McInnes) or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. Every link verified (HTTP 200).

**Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build intuition** — watch [Clustering with DBSCAN, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDZUdRSDOok) (**StatQuest**), then play with [Visualizing DBSCAN](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-dbscan-clustering/). *Watch density reachability grow clusters with the slider and leave noise behind.*
2. **Get the point taxonomy** — watch [DBSCAN - Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoR_crzMAhQ) (**DataMListic**). *Core / border / noise and density-reachability — the formal idea behind the picture.*
3. **Choose the parameters** — watch [DBSCAN Clustering Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry7oCBSzFlc) (**M Iqbal**). *How `ε` and `minPts` interact, and reading `ε` off the k-distance elbow.*
4. **Read the source** — the [DBSCAN paper (Ester et al., 1996)](https://cdn.aaai.org/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf). *The original density definitions — directly density-reachable, density-reachable, density-connected — straight from the Test-of-Time paper.*
5. **See the successor for varying density** — read [How HDBSCAN works](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html). *Mutual-reachability + the condensed tree — DBSCAN generalized to all densities at once.*
6. **Make it concrete** — code it with [scikit-learn DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#dbscan) and run the [DBSCAN demo](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.html). *Tuning `ε`/`minPts` on real data cements it.*

**In this platform:**
- Concept page (full explanation): [DBSCAN](dbscan.md)
- Contrast with: [01 K-Means Clustering](../k-means-clustering/k-means-clustering.md) (centroid vs density) · [02 Hierarchical Clustering](../hierarchical-clustering/hierarchical-clustering.md) · [04 Gaussian Mixture Models & EM](../gaussian-mixture-models-and-em/gaussian-mixture-models-and-em.md) (soft, probabilistic clustering)
- Builds on this: [09 Anomaly / Outlier Detection](../../anomaly-detection/anomaly-outlier-detection/anomaly-outlier-detection.md) — DBSCAN's "noise" label is a form of outlier detection.
- Prereqs (the *why* behind the metric): [k-Nearest Neighbors](../../../supervised-learning/classification/k-nearest-neighbors/k-nearest-neighbors.md) (the same neighborhood/KD-tree machinery) · [ai-ml-intuitions 1.07–1.08 Euclidean vs Cosine Distance](../../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/representation/similarity-and-distance/cosine-vs-euclidean-distance-intuition.md) — density/neighborhoods are defined by the distance metric.
