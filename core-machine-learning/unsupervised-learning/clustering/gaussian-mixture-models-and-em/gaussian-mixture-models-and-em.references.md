# Gaussian Mixture Models & EM — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Gaussian Mixture Models & EM](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/core-machine-learning/unsupervised-learning/clustering/gaussian-mixture-models-and-em/gaussian-mixture-models-and-em)** (the concept page). Curated links — external sources *and* internal cross-links — kept separate so this can double as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is a primary author or a recognized deep explainer, chosen for depth on *this* topic, and every link verified.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Gaussian Mixture Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q71Niz856KE) (**Luis Serrano**). *Soft clustering with bell curves; see why "soft" beats "hard."*
2. **See why EM works** — watch [EM algorithm: how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REypj2sy_5U) (**Victor Lavrenko**). *The E/M loop and why each iteration improves the likelihood.*
3. **Get the math** — read [CS229 Notes — The EM Algorithm](https://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2020spring/cs229-notes8.pdf) (**Andrew Ng, Stanford**). *Responsibilities, the ELBO/Jensen lower bound, and the closed-form M-step.*
4. **Read the source** — skim [Maximum Likelihood from Incomplete Data via the EM Algorithm](https://web.mit.edu/6.435/www/Dempster77.pdf) (**Dempster, Laird & Rubin, 1977**). *The paper that unified EM; GMM fitting is its special case.*
5. **Make it concrete** — fit and select with [scikit-learn — Gaussian mixtures](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html) + the [BIC selection example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/mixture/plot_gmm_selection.html). *Covariance types, EM fitting, and choosing k.*
