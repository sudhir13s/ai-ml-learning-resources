# Unsupervised Learning
> Finding structure without labels — clustering (k-means, DBSCAN), dimensionality reduction
> (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), and density estimation.

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) with its page and a curated
`.references.md` resource card (free, open courses · videos · papers · articles · books · cross-links).
