# Anomaly / Outlier Detection — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Anomaly / Outlier Detection](anomaly-outlier-detection.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame the problem** — watch [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNEJHbophM) (**Data Science Garage**). *Where clustering, density, and isolation methods each apply.*
2. **Learn the go-to method** — watch [Isolation Forest: a tree-based approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqAxfOPlr1U) (**Pratik Nabriya**). *Why random partitioning isolates anomalies in fewer splits — the key intuition.*
3. **See local density** — watch [Local Outlier Factor, explained with an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W3mTEKTORg) (**Endless Engineering**). *Why a point can be normal globally but an outlier relative to its neighbours.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Isolation Forest (Liu, Ting & Zhou, 2008)](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf) → [LOF (Breunig et al., 2000)](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/LOF.pdf). *The path-length and local-density definitions in their original form.*
5. **Make it concrete** — code all three with the [scikit-learn outlier detection guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html) and compare them on the [anomaly-comparison demo](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/miscellaneous/plot_anomaly_comparison.html). *Seeing where each fails cements the choice.*
