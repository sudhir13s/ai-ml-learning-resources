# Dimensionality Reduction — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Dimensionality Reduction — Overview](dimensionality-reduction-overview.md)** (the concept page, PCA-centric). Curated links — external sources *and* internal cross-links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is a primary author or a recognized deep explainer, chosen for depth on *this* topic, and every link verified.

**Start here — suggested path:**
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Luis Serrano: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Hb26agBFg). *The "best camera angle on a cloud" picture — variance and projection without heavy math.*
2. **See it move** — play with [Setosa: PCA, interactive](https://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/). *Drag the cloud and watch the principal axes rotate to follow it; the best visual intuition, fully free.*
3. **Get the math (two views)** — read [Shlens, "A Tutorial on PCA"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1100). *Derives PCA from variance maximization AND from the SVD — exactly the two derivations interviews want.*
4. **Map the landscape** — skim the [scikit-learn comparison of manifold methods](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_compare_methods.html). *See PCA (linear) next to t-SNE / Isomap / LLE / UMAP on the same data.*
5. **Make it concrete** — apply PCA with the [scikit-learn decomposition guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca), inspect the explained-variance ratio, then jump to the [t-SNE](../t-sne/t-sne.md) / [UMAP](../umap/umap.md) pages for the non-linear methods.

**Videos:**
- [PCA, main ideas in only 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMOI_lkzW08) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — the fastest correct mental model of components and scree.
- [PCA, Step-by-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ) — **StatQuest (Josh Starmer)** — components, loadings, and scree plots built from scratch.
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Hb26agBFg) — **Luis Serrano** — illustrations-over-formulas intro; the best first watch for variance/projection.
- [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and PCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXbThCXjZFM) — **Steve Brunton (UW)** — the SVD view of PCA, the numerically preferred route, derived cleanly.
