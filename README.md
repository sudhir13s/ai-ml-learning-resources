# 🌐 AI-ML Learning Resources

> A **curated library of the best free resources on the internet** for learning AI / ML / DL —
> not a link dump. For each topic, a short shortlist of *the* best courses, videos, papers,
> articles, and books, chosen for **authority and clarity** (top institutions, researchers, and
> the people who explained it best), and **free / open** wherever possible.

## The curation bar
- **Authoritative** — Stanford/MIT/DeepMind/Anthropic, seminal-paper authors, 3Blue1Brown, Karpathy, Olah, StatQuest… the best explainer, not the top SEO result.
- **Free / open** preferred (audit links, free books, open courses).
- **~2 per type** — a couple of courses, videos, papers, articles, books. Curated, not exhaustive.
- Every entry says **who made it and why it's the best**.

## Structure (one pattern, everywhere)
The tree is the chartered one: **section → sub-area → topic package**, all kebab-case, with
`course.yaml` declaring the sections and a `metadata.yaml` (`page-order:`) fixing the reading
order inside every sub-area. A topic package holds its teaching page, its
`*.references.md` companion, and its own `images/`, `code/` and `notebooks/` assets. Sub-areas
keep a single **`README.md`** — the curated resource index, with YAML frontmatter
(`id`, `topic`, `level`, `prereqs`) and sections for Courses / Videos / Papers / Articles /
Books. *This consistent, parseable format lets the library double as a dataset for the
interview-prep project.*
