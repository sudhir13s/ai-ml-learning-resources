# How Models Learn — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[How Models Learn](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/ai-ml-orientation/how-models-learn/how-models-learn)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Everything here is free / open, and every "Source / derivation" citation on the concept page appears below.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Feel it move** — watch [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w) (**3Blue1Brown**). *The ball-rolling-downhill picture on a real loss surface — the best 20 minutes for making learning click.*
2. **See the algorithm with numbers** — watch [Gradient Descent, Step-by-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDv4f4s2SB8) (**StatQuest**). *The exact loop — predict, loss, gradient, step — worked on concrete numbers, no hand-waving.*
3. **Get loss precisely** — read [Google ML Crash Course — Loss](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/loss) then [Gradient descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/gradient-descent) (**Google**). *What the loss measures and how the update step uses its gradient, with interactive widgets.*
4. **Build the whole loop in code** — watch [Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU) (**Samson Zhang**). *Forward pass → loss → gradient → update in plain NumPy — the same thing this chapter's module does.*
5. **Learn to measure honestly** — read [Google — Dividing datasets](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/overfitting/dividing-datasets) + watch [StatQuest: Cross Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSytzGwwBVw). *Why train / validation / test (and k-fold) keep you from fooling yourself.*

**Videos**:
- [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w) — **3Blue1Brown** — the canonical visual intuition for minimising a loss by walking downhill.

**Courses (free)**:
- [Google ML Crash Course — Linear Regression (Loss & Gradient Descent)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/loss) — **Google** — the cleanest loss → gradient-descent walkthrough, with interactive widgets and a learning-rate playground.

**Interactive & visual**:
- [Google — Gradient Descent & Learning Rate playground](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/gradient-descent) — **Google** — drag the learning rate and watch the loss converge, crawl, or diverge — the sweep from this chapter, interactive.
- [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) — **Google** — train a small network in the browser and watch the loss fall as the boundary forms; the loop made tangible.

**Articles / blogs (free, no paywall)**:
- [An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms](https://www.ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) — **Sebastian Ruder** — the reference survey of SGD, momentum, and Adam; read once the intuition lands.
- [Gradient Descent — explained](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent) — **IBM** — a clear text walkthrough of the optimization loop and the learning rate.
- [Cross-validation: evaluating estimator performance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) — **scikit-learn docs** — train/val/test and k-fold with runnable code.
- [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) — **Andrej Karpathy** — how the loop behaves in practice, and the failure modes (great once you've trained a few models).

**Key sources / derivations** (cited on the concept page):
