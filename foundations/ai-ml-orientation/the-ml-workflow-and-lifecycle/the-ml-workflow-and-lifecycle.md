# The ML Workflow & Lifecycle
> Every ML project follows the same arc: **frame the problem → collect & explore data → prepare
> features → train a model → evaluate → deploy → monitor → iterate.** It's a *loop*, not a line —
> you cycle back constantly. The famous rule of thumb: 50–80% of the work is data, not modeling.

**Why it matters:** interviewers ask "walk me through how you'd approach an ML project end to end"
to see if you think like a practitioner, not just an algorithm-memorizer. Knowing the lifecycle
(and that data prep dominates, and that deployment/monitoring are where projects actually fail) is
what separates someone who's shipped ML from someone who's only done tutorials.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the whole loop** — watch [The 7 Steps of Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKW8Ndu7Mjw). *Google's clean, beginner overview of the end-to-end arc.*
2. **Learn the industry-standard process** — watch [Introduction to CRISP-DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_okDS2RtzY), then read [What is CRISP-DM?](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/). *The 6-phase methodology that names every stage you'll repeat on real projects.*
3. **Internalize why data dominates** — watch [Andrew Ng on data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo). *Why improving data beats tweaking models — the most important lifecycle lesson.*
4. **Read the hard-won rules** — skim [Google: Rules of ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml). *Battle-tested guidance for each lifecycle stage from Google engineers.*
5. **Watch one go end to end** — work through part of [ML for Everybody – Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg). *See data → train → evaluate happen in code, start to finish.*
