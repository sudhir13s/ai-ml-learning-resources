# Overfitting & Underfitting — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Overfitting & Underfitting](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/ai-ml-orientation/overfitting-and-underfitting/overfitting-and-underfitting)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Everything here is free / open, and every "Source / derivation" citation on the concept page appears below.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Feel the tradeoff** — play with [MLU-Explain: The Bias-Variance Tradeoff](https://mlu-explain.github.io/bias-variance/) (**Amazon**). *Drag model complexity and watch bias fall while variance rises — the crossover this chapter measures, animated under your cursor.*
2. **Get the framework** — watch [Machine Learning Fundamentals: Bias and Variance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBBz3bI-aA) (**StatQuest**). *The tradeoff that explains why over- and under-fitting happen, in six clear minutes.*
3. **Read it precisely** — [Google ML Crash Course — Overfitting & Generalization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/overfitting/overfitting) (**Google**). *Generalization, the train/validation gap, and why simpler can be better, with widgets.*
4. **Learn the cures** — watch [Regularization Part 1: Ridge (L2) Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30) + [Cross Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSytzGwwBVw) (**StatQuest**). *Regularization and CV — your two main weapons against overfitting.*
5. **See it in code** — run [scikit-learn: Underfitting vs Overfitting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html) (**scikit-learn**). *Fit too-simple / too-complex / just-right models and watch the curves — the same experiment as this chapter's module.*
