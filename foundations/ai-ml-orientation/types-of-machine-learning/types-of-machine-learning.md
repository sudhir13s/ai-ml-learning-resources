# Types of Machine Learning — Supervised · Unsupervised · Reinforcement
> The three learning paradigms, split by *what feedback the model gets*. **Supervised:** learn from
> labeled examples (input → known answer). **Unsupervised:** find structure in unlabeled data (no
> answers given). **Reinforcement:** learn by trial and error from rewards. Most real systems are
> supervised; understanding all three tells you which tool fits which problem.

**Why it matters:** "What are the types of machine learning?" is asked in nearly every screen.
The follow-up — "is this a classification or clustering problem?" / "when would you use RL?" — tests
whether you can map a *business problem* to the right paradigm, which is the first thing you do on any
real project.

**Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the supervised case first** — watch [A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI) — **StatQuest**. *The paradigm you will meet most, with the vocabulary the other two are defined against.*
2. **Lock in supervised vs unsupervised** — read [Google: Types of ML systems](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/intro-to-ml/supervised). *The two you'll meet most, defined precisely with the classification/regression vs clustering split.*
3. **Make unsupervised concrete** — watch [StatQuest: K-means clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA). *Structure discovered with no labels, so the contrast with supervised learning becomes physical rather than definitional.*
4. **Understand reinforcement learning** — watch [RL: Crash Course AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIgIv4IfJ6s). *Agent, environment, reward — the loop that trains game players and robots.*
5. **Map problems to paradigms** — skim [Google: Framing an ML problem](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing/ml-framing). *Turn "we want to predict X" into the right learning type and label.*
