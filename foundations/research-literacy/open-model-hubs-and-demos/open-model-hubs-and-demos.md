# Open Model Hubs & Demos (Hugging Face / Spaces)
> Where open models, datasets, and runnable demos live — and how to use them to *try* a new method in
> minutes instead of reading about it for hours. The Hugging Face Hub (models + datasets + Spaces),
> plus local runners like Ollama, are how you go from "I heard about this model" to "I ran it."

**Why it matters:** the fastest way to understand a new model is to use it. Knowing how to pull a
model from the Hub, run a Space demo, or load it locally turns the frontier from headlines into
hands-on experience — and "have you actually used X?" is a question that separates readers from
practitioners in interviews.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Tour the Hub** — browse ⭐ [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models) and [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets); sort by trending/downloads. *The Hub is the field's app store for open models; trending tells you what people actually use.*
2. **Try a demo with zero setup** — open a few [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and interact with live models in the browser. *Spaces let you experience a model's behavior before writing a line of code.*
3. **Run a model in code** — follow the [Transformers quickstart](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to load a model in a few lines. *Loading a pipeline is the "hello world" of using the frontier hands-on.*
4. **Run one locally** — use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (or [GGUF via the Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/ollama)) to run an open model on your machine. *Local inference removes API/cost friction and deepens your intuition for size/latency trade-offs.*
5. **Read model cards critically** — check the model card for training data, license, eval, and limitations before trusting it. *The model card is where capability claims meet caveats — a direct tie-in to "hype vs substance."*
