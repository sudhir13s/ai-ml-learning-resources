# Reproducing Papers (code)
> Turning a paper into working code — finding the official repo, running it, or re-implementing the
> method from scratch — and judging whether the reported results actually reproduce. The deepest way
> to *understand* a method, and the skill that separates "I read it" from "I can build it."

**Why it matters:** "implement this paper / why might it not reproduce?" is a real interview and job
task. Re-implementing forces you to confront the details papers gloss over (init, LR schedule, data
pipeline, eval protocol) — and the reproducibility crisis means knowing *why* results don't transfer
(seeds, undisclosed tricks, hardware, data leakage) is itself a valued skill.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Find existing code first** — check ⭐ [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) and the paper's repo before writing anything. *Running the authors' code is the fastest way to confirm the result and read the real implementation.*
2. **Learn the re-implementation workflow** — work through [PyTorch Paper Replicating](https://www.learnpytorch.io/08_pytorch_paper_replicating/) (ViT from the paper). *A worked example of going from a figure/equation to running code is the template you'll reuse.*
3. **Reproduce in passes** — get the model to *run* on a tiny input, then match shapes, then match the training loop, then match the number. *Incremental reproduction localizes bugs; chasing the final metric first hides them.*
4. **Use a reproducibility checklist** — apply the ⭐ [ML Reproducibility Checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf) and [releasing-research-code](https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code) practices. *Checklists surface the undisclosed details (seeds, splits, hyperparameters) that make or break a repro.*
5. **Know why repro fails** — read about the reproducibility crisis and seed/variance effects. *Understanding contamination, cherry-picked seeds, and environment drift is how you judge whether a result is real.*
