# Benchmarks & Leaderboards to Watch
> The standardized tasks and public rankings that let you compare models objectively — and the
> skill of reading them critically (what a benchmark measures, where it saturates, and how it gets
> gamed). Leaderboards are how the field tracks progress; knowing which to trust is half the battle.

**Why it matters:** "how would you evaluate / which model is best for X?" is a core interview and
on-the-job question. You need to know the major benchmarks (MMLU, HumanEval, Chatbot Arena, HELM,
SWE-bench), what each actually tests, and the failure modes — contamination, saturation, and
overfitting to the leaderboard — so you don't mistake a high score for real capability.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Learn what benchmarks measure** — read ⭐ [30 LLM benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks). *Each benchmark tests a narrow slice (knowledge, code, reasoning); knowing the slice is how you read a score correctly.*
2. **Watch the live leaderboards** — bookmark [Chatbot Arena / LMArena](https://lmarena.ai/) (human-preference Elo) and [Papers with Code SOTA](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) (task-level). *Human-preference and task-level rankings answer different questions; use both.*
3. **Understand rigorous, multi-metric eval** — skim [Stanford HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/). *HELM evaluates many models on many scenarios with many metrics — the antidote to single-number hype.*
4. **Know the failure modes** — read about contamination/saturation in the Chatbot Arena and benchmark-survey papers. *A benchmark stops being useful once it's saturated or leaks into training data; spotting this is the key skill.*
5. **Run an eval yourself** — try the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) on a small model. *Reproducing a benchmark number teaches you how brittle and configuration-dependent these scores are.*
