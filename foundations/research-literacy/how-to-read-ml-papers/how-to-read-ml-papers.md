# How to Read ML Papers
> A repeatable, multi-pass system for extracting the idea, the evidence, and the limitations from an
> ML paper — without reading every word. The single highest-leverage skill for staying current:
> the field moves in papers, and the people who keep up are the ones who can triage 20 and deep-read 2.

**Why it matters:** in interviews and on the job you'll be handed a paper ("walk me through how
this works / would you trust this result?") and expected to find the contribution, the baseline,
the ablations, and the threats to validity fast. Reading skill is what separates "I saw the
headline" from "I understand the method and its limits."

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Adopt the three-pass method** — read ⭐ ["How to Read a Paper" (Keshav)](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf), one page, then watch [Andrew Ng on reading papers (CS230 Lec 8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI). *Pass 1 = title/abstract/figures/conclusion; pass 2 = method + results skim; pass 3 = reconstruct it yourself. This is the backbone of everything below.*
2. **Practice triage** — read titles → abstracts → figures of 10 papers in your area before deep-reading any. *Andrew Ng's rule: 5–20 papers gives basic grasp of a field, 50–100 gives mastery. Breadth first, depth on demand.*
3. **Read for the contribution and the evidence** — for each paper answer: what's new? what's the baseline? what do the ablations remove? *A method "works" only relative to a baseline; the ablation table tells you which part actually matters.*
4. **Hunt the limitations** — read the limitations/related-work sections and ask what the authors did *not* test. *This is the "evaluate hype vs substance" muscle — and exactly what interviewers probe.*
5. **Reconstruct, then move on** — write 3 sentences (problem / method / result) in your own words; only re-open the paper if you'd build on it. *Active recall beats re-reading; the note becomes your searchable memory.*
