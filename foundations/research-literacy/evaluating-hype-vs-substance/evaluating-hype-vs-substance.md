# Evaluating Hype vs Substance
> The judgment skill that ties this whole section together: separating real, durable progress from

**Why it matters:** the field generates more claims than results. Interviewers and teams value people
who ask "what's the baseline? is the eval contaminated? does this generalize?" instead of repeating
hype. Knowing the common failure modes — unsupported claims, data leakage, saturated benchmarks,
cherry-picked examples — is what makes you a trustworthy reader of the frontier.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Internalize the failure modes** — read ⭐ [Troubling Trends in ML Scholarship](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03341). *Explanation-vs-speculation, unsupported claims, and misuse of math are the patterns you'll spot again and again.*
2. **Learn the data-leakage trap** — read [Leakage and the Reproducibility Crisis in ML-based Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02831). *Most "too good" results are leakage; recognizing it is the single highest-value skepticism skill.*
3. **Apply a claims checklist** — for any result ask: baseline? ablations? variance/seeds? contamination? held-out generalization? *A fixed checklist converts vague doubt into specific, answerable questions.*
4. **Read a critic regularly** — follow ⭐ [AI Snake Oil](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/) (Narayanan & Kapoor). *A disciplined skeptic models how to deflate hype without dismissing real progress.*
5. **Trace claims to primary sources** — when a headline excites you, find the paper and read its eval/limitations (card 01). *The gap between the tweet and the limitations section is where hype lives.*
