# Handling Date/Time & Cyclical Features
> Turning timestamps into useful signals — extracting hour/day/month/weekday, computing elapsed time and
> lags, and encoding periodic features with sine/cosine so "23:00" and "00:00" are correctly *close*.

**Why it matters:** raw datetimes are useless to most models, and naively encoding hour as 0–23 tells the
model that hour 23 and hour 0 are maximally far apart — wrong. Expect to explain datetime decomposition,
the **sine/cosine cyclical encoding** trick for periodic features (hour, month, day-of-week), lag/rolling
features for time series, and the time-aware leakage trap (never use future rows; split chronologically).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Decompose datetimes** — watch [Handling Date & Time Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J73mvgG9fFs). *Extracting components and elapsed-time features.*
2. **In pandas** — watch [Extract Hour/Day/Month from DateTime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjMTZIxgkYo). *The practical `.dt` accessor workflow.*
3. **Cyclical encoding** — watch [Cyclic Encoding for time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceh36yGRQ2w). *Why sine/cosine make periodicity continuous.*
4. **See it done right** — read [sklearn: Cyclical feature engineering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_cyclical_feature_engineering.html). *Trigonometric vs spline encodings on a real bike-share dataset.*
5. **Time-series predictors** — read [FPP3: Useful predictors](https://otexts.com/fpp3/useful-predictors.html). *Trend, seasonal dummies, and Fourier terms for forecasting.*
