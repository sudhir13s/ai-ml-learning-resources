# Feature Engineering
> Creating better inputs from raw data — combining columns, splitting fields, binning, log/power
> transforms, and interaction terms — so a model can learn relationships it otherwise couldn't.

**Why it matters:** "better data beats fancier algorithms" — feature engineering is where most real-world
accuracy gains come from, and the classic interview line is *"feature engineering is the part of ML that
domain knowledge buys you."* Be ready to walk through constructing a feature, why log/Box-Cox fixes skew,
when binning helps tree-free models, and how to engineer **without leaking** future or target information.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Construct features** — watch [Feature Construction & Splitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma-h30PoFms). *Combining and decomposing columns into informative features.*
2. **Fix skew** — watch [Function Transformer: log / sqrt / reciprocal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTjj3LE8E90). *Making distributions more normal so models behave.*
3. **Power transforms** — watch [Power Transformer: Box-Cox / Yeo-Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV_Z4HbNAx0). *Principled, data-driven variance stabilization.*
4. **Discretize** — watch [Binning & Binarization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKWsJGKcMvo). *Turning continuous values into buckets, and when it helps.*
5. **Internalize the principle** — read [A Few Useful Things to Know about ML](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf). *Domingos on why feature engineering is the key to applied ML.*
