# Outlier Detection & Treatment
> Finding the points that don't fit — via Z-score, IQR, or percentiles — then deciding whether to keep,
> cap (winsorize), transform, or drop them, depending on whether they're errors or genuine extremes.

**Why it matters:** outliers wreck mean-based statistics, distort scaling, and skew linear models — but
blindly deleting them throws away signal (fraud, anomalies, the very thing you may want to detect). Expect
to compare Z-score vs IQR vs percentile rules, explain why median/IQR are robust while mean/std aren't, and
justify capping vs removal vs a log transform — and to do detection **using training-set statistics only**.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **What is an outlier** — watch [What are Outliers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lln1PKgGr_M). *Defines outliers and why they matter before any method.*
2. **Z-score method** — watch [Outlier removal using Z-score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnPE-Z8jtqM). *The ±3σ rule and its Gaussian assumption.*
3. **IQR method** — watch [Outlier removal using IQR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccv1-W5ilak). *The robust 1.5×IQR fences that don't assume normality.*
4. **Cap instead of drop** — watch [Percentile method & Winsorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcXA4CqRXvM). *When to clip extremes rather than delete rows.*
5. **Reference detectors** — read [sklearn: Novelty & outlier detection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html). *Isolation Forest, LOF, Elliptic Envelope for multivariate outliers.*
