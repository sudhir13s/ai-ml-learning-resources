# Feature Scaling & Normalization — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Feature Scaling & Normalization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/data-preparation/feature-scaling-and-normalization/feature-scaling-and-normalization)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Everything here is free / open, and every "Source / derivation" citation on the concept page appears below.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the distinction** — watch [StatQuest: Normalization vs. Standardization, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YpKUpitT98) (**StatQuest**). *The single most-asked framing — which one, when — cleared up in a few minutes.*
2. **Feel why it matters** — read [Importance of feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_scaling_importance.html) (**scikit-learn**). *Scaling materially changing PCA + a classifier's results, on the same Wine dataset this chapter uses.*
3. **See all the scalers at once** — read [Compare the effect of different scalers on data with outliers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.html) (**scikit-learn**). *Standard / min-max / robust / quantile side by side — the outlier behaviour made visual.*
4. **Learn it applied** — do [Google ML Crash Course — Numerical data: Normalization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/numerical-data/normalization) (**Google**). *Z-score, min-max, log and clipping, with interactive widgets and when to use each.*
5. **Run it yourself** — open [this chapter's notebook](code/feature-scaling-and-normalization.ipynb). *Rebuild the three scalers, match them to scikit-learn, and measure the accuracy jump on real Wine.*
