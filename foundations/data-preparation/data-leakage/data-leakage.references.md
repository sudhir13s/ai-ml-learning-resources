# Data Leakage — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Data Leakage](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/foundations/data-preparation/data-leakage/data-leakage)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Everything here is free / open, and every "Source / derivation" citation on the concept page appears below.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the definition** — watch [What is Data Leakage in Machine Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9jz7G68pVg) (**Krish Naik**). *The clearest short definition, with practical examples of both contamination and target leakage.*
2. **See concrete leaky features** — watch [Examples of Data or Target Leakage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaySLPTCgDM) (**Rajistics**). *Real features that secretly encode the answer, and how they fool a model.*
3. **Do the hands-on lesson** — do [Kaggle Learn: Data Leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/data-leakage) (**Kaggle**). *Target leakage vs train-test contamination, worked on real data with code.*
4. **Learn the structural fix** — read [Common pitfalls and recommended practices — Data leakage](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html#data-leakage) (**scikit-learn**). *Why `Pipeline` + fit-on-train-only makes leakage structurally impossible, with runnable code.*
5. **Read the formal treatment** — read [Leakage in Data Mining](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~ding/history/470_670_fall_2011/papers/cs670_Tran_PreferredPaper_LeakingInDataMining.pdf) (**Kaufman, Rosset, Perlich & Stitelman, 2012**). *The definitive taxonomy, detection, and avoidance — the paper everyone cites.*
6. **Run it yourself** — open [this chapter's notebook](code/data-leakage.ipynb). *Watch a leaky protocol report 0.86 on pure noise and the Pipeline fix collapse it to 0.48, then measure a real target leak and a temporal leak.*
