# Data Handling, Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
> 80% of real ML work. Cleaning, scaling, encoding, splitting, and engineering features that
> make models work — before any model is trained.

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) — pick a concept to open its
page: a short guided learning path plus the best **free, open** courses, videos, papers, articles,
and books for that topic.
