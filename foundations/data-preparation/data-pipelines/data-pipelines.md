# Data Pipelines (sklearn Pipeline · ColumnTransformer)
> Chaining every preprocessing step + the model into one fit/transform object — so the exact same
> transforms (fit on train) apply to validation, test, and production, and nothing leaks across the split.

**Why it matters:** pipelines are how you make preprocessing **correct and reproducible**. Fitting a scaler
or imputer on the whole dataset is the #1 cause of leakage; a `Pipeline` + `ColumnTransformer` fits all
transforms on training folds only, applies them consistently everywhere, and serializes cleanly for
deployment. Interviewers love this because it ties together scaling, encoding, imputation, CV, and leakage
into one production-grade pattern.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Why pipelines** — watch [Pipelines A-Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOccYkgRV4Q). *What problem they solve and how fit/predict flow.*
2. **Different columns, different transforms** — watch [ColumnTransformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TVj6iEBR4I). *Numeric → scale, categorical → encode, in one object.*
3. **Build one end to end** — watch [ML Pipeline step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9ETsSD1I0w). *Preprocessing + model + cross-validation together.*
4. **Read the reference** — read [sklearn: Pipelines & composite estimators](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html). *Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, FeatureUnion, get_feature_names_out.*
5. **Lock in leakage-safety** — read [sklearn: Common pitfalls](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html). *Why pipelines + CV are the structural fix for leakage.*
