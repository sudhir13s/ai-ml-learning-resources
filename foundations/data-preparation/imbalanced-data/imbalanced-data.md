# Imbalanced Data
> When one class vastly outnumbers another (fraud, disease, churn) — handled via resampling
> (under/oversampling, SMOTE), class weights, or threshold tuning — and evaluated with metrics that
> don't reward predicting the majority class.

**Why it matters:** with 99% negatives, a model that predicts "negative" always scores 99% accuracy and is
useless — so this topic tests whether you know to use precision/recall/F1/PR-AUC instead, and the three
families of fixes: **resampling** (SMOTE, random under/over), **algorithmic** (class_weight='balanced',
scale_pos_weight), and **threshold tuning**. The classic trap: SMOTE must be applied **inside CV, on
training folds only** — never before the split.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Frame the problem** — watch [Balanced vs Imbalanced Datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR-eWajtTfo). *Why accuracy lies and what to do instead.*
2. **Resampling in practice** — watch [Handling Imbalanced Datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnlM4yLFNuo). *Under/oversampling with code.*
3. **SMOTE** — watch [SMOTE explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3X98xZ4_no). *How synthetic minority samples are generated.*
4. **Weights vs resampling** — watch [Class Weights vs Resampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xotLmq8YkAw). *The often-better, simpler alternative.*
5. **Use the right metrics** — read [ROC vs PR curves (sklearn)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html). *Why PR-AUC beats ROC-AUC under heavy imbalance.*
