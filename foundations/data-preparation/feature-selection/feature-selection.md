# Feature Selection
> Choosing the subset of features that actually helps — via filter (statistics), wrapper (search), or
> embedded (model-driven) methods — to fight the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, and noise.

**Why it matters:** more features isn't better — irrelevant/redundant ones add variance, slow training,
and hurt interpretability. Interviewers want the three families (filter vs wrapper vs embedded), concrete
examples (variance threshold, correlation/mutual-information, RFE, L1/Lasso, tree importances), and the
crucial gotcha: **feature selection must happen inside cross-validation**, on training folds only, or you
leak and over-report performance.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **The three families** — watch [Filter vs Wrapper vs Embedded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-TNxW3PiI). *The taxonomy every answer should start from.*
2. **Filter in practice** — watch [Drop features using correlation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FndwYNcVe0U). *Removing redundant/constant features cheaply.*
3. **The right relevance metric** — watch [Mutual Information, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJIp_mgVLwE). *Why MI catches nonlinear relevance that correlation misses.*
4. **Read the reference** — read [sklearn: Feature selection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html). *VarianceThreshold, SelectKBest, RFE, SelectFromModel, L1-based.*
5. **Trust importances carefully** — read [sklearn: Permutation importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.html). *Why impurity importance misleads and permutation importance is safer.*
