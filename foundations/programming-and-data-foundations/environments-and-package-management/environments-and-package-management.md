# Environments & Package Management — uv · conda · pip
> Every ML project depends on specific versions of NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, and dozens more. A
> **virtual environment** is an isolated sandbox so each project gets its own dependencies without
> clashing. **pip** installs packages, **venv** isolates them, **conda** does both (plus non-Python
> deps), and **uv** is the fast, modern all-in-one. Get this right early and you avoid the #1 source
> of "it works on my machine" pain.

**Why it matters:** "how do you manage dependencies / reproduce an environment?" comes up in any
practical or MLOps-flavored interview, and broken environments are the most common reason a beginner's
project won't run. Reproducibility (a lockfile or `requirements.txt`) is a real engineering skill.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Understand *why* environments exist** — watch [Python Virtual Environments — Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y21OR1OPC9A). *Isolation and dependency clashes, made concrete.*
2. **Learn the standard pip + venv flow** — read [Installing packages with pip and venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). *The official, always-works baseline every Python dev knows.*
3. **See it hands-on** — watch [Corey Schafer: venv (Mac & Linux)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg1Yvry_Ydk). *Create, activate, freeze, and remove an environment.*
4. **Meet the modern tool** — watch [UV: a faster all-in-one package manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMdG7IjgSPM) + read [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). *The fast, lockfile-first workflow that's becoming the default.*
5. **Know when to use conda** — skim [conda getting started](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html). *Why data science often reaches for conda (binary/GPU deps).*
