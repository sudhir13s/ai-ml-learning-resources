# JAX (+ Flax) — Functional Autodiff · jit · vmap · pmap
> A NumPy-compatible array library with **composable function transformations**: `grad` (autodiff),
> `jit` (XLA compilation to fast fused kernels), `vmap` (auto-vectorization/batching), and `pmap`
> (multi-device parallelism). **Flax** layers a neural-network library on top. The functional,
> pure-function style makes high-performance research code reproducible and easy to parallelize.

**Why it matters:** JAX is the framework of choice for a lot of cutting-edge research (and TPUs).
It tests a different mental model than PyTorch — pure functions and immutable state, `grad` as a
function transform, why `jit` needs static shapes/tracing, and `vmap`/`pmap` for batching and
scaling. Understanding it sharpens your grasp of autodiff and compilation in general.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the four transforms** — read the [JAX Quickstart](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/quickstart.html). *`grad`, `jit`, `vmap` in a few cells — the whole idea in one page.*
2. **Shift your mental model** — work [Thinking in JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html). *Pure functions, tracing, and why JAX differs from NumPy/PyTorch — the key to not getting surprised.*
3. **Watch the intro** — [Intro to JAX: Accelerating ML research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdTeDXsOSj4) (Google). *A concise official overview of the design and why it's fast.*
4. **Go hero-level on video** — [Machine Learning with JAX — From Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SstuvS-tVc0) (Aleksa Gordić). *Builds real intuition for PyTrees, stateless models, and transforms.*
5. **Add neural nets with Flax** — follow [Flax NNX basics](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx_basics.html). *Flax gives you Modules and training state on top of pure JAX.*
