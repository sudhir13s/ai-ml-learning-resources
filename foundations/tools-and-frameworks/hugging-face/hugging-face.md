# Hugging Face — Transformers · Datasets · Hub
> The center of gravity for modern NLP/LLM work: **Transformers** (load and run thousands of
> pretrained models with a uniform API), **Datasets** (efficient, streaming data loading),
> **Tokenizers**, and the **Hub** (the GitHub of models and datasets). The `pipeline()` one-liner
> takes you from "I want sentiment analysis" to a working model in three lines.

**Why it matters:** almost every applied LLM/NLP role expects Hugging Face fluency — `pipeline`,
`AutoModel`/`AutoTokenizer`, fine-tuning with `Trainer`, loading/streaming datasets, and pushing to
the Hub. It is the practical layer on top of the transformer architecture and the default toolkit
for RAG, fine-tuning, and inference.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Run a model in 3 lines** — [Transformers quick tour](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quicktour). *The `pipeline()` API gives an instant win and the right mental model.*
2. **See it on video** — [Getting Started With Hugging Face in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaBAZQCtwE) (AssemblyAI). *Pipelines, tokenizers, and models in one quick pass.*
3. **Take the official course** — start the free [LLM/NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1). *The authoritative path through Transformers, Datasets, Tokenizers, and the Hub.*
4. **Learn fine-tuning & Datasets** — work the course chapters on `Trainer` and the [Datasets docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index). *Fine-tuning and efficient data loading are the most common real tasks.*
5. **Publish to the Hub** — follow the [Hub docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) to push a model/dataset. *Understanding the Hub (repos, model cards, Spaces) is part of the workflow.*
