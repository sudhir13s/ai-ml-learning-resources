# scikit-learn — Classical ML · Pipelines · Model Selection
> The standard library for classical machine learning in Python: a consistent
> `fit`/`predict`/`transform` API across dozens of algorithms, plus preprocessing, `Pipeline`s,
> cross-validation, and hyperparameter search. The fastest path from a DataFrame to a trained,
> evaluated model.

**Why it matters:** before reaching for deep learning, most real problems are solved with
scikit-learn — and interviews lean on its concepts: train/test splits and leakage, cross-validation,
the estimator API, building leak-proof `Pipeline`s, and `GridSearchCV`/`RandomizedSearchCV`. It is
also where you internalize the *workflow* of supervised learning.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the API shape** — read [Getting Started](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html). *The unified `fit`/`predict`/`transform` API is the whole library in one idea.*
2. **Do a guided course** — start the [scikit-learn MOOC](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/) (INRIA, the maintainers). *The best free, hands-on course on the predictive-modeling workflow.*
3. **Watch the workflow live** — [Scikit-learn Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B5eIE_1vpU) (freeCodeCamp). *A concept-driven tour: preprocessing, metrics, meta-estimators.*
4. **Avoid leakage with Pipelines** — study the [User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) on Pipelines, preprocessing, and cross-validation. *Pipelines + proper CV are the #1 thing interviews and real projects get wrong.*
5. **Adapt from examples** — browse the [example gallery](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html). *Finding a worked example near your problem is the real practitioner workflow.*
