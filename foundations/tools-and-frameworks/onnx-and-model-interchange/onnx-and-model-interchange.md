# ONNX & Model Interchange — Export · Runtime · Portability
> The **Open Neural Network Exchange**: a standard, framework-agnostic format for representing models
> as a computation graph, plus **ONNX Runtime**, a high-performance cross-platform inference engine.
> Train in PyTorch or TensorFlow, export to ONNX, and run anywhere — server, browser, mobile, edge —
> with graph optimizations and hardware acceleration.

**Why it matters:** model portability and inference performance are core deployment concerns, and
ONNX is the lingua franca that decouples training framework from serving target. Interviews and
real work touch on why you'd export to ONNX, how the graph + opsets work, ONNX Runtime's graph
optimizations (fusion, constant folding), and how it enables hardware-specific execution providers.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Grasp the concept** — read [ONNX Concepts](https://onnx.ai/onnx/intro/concepts.html). *Understand the model-as-graph + operators/opsets idea — that's the whole format.*
2. **See an export end to end** — [Export a PyTorch model to ONNX](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/onnx/intro_onnx.html). *The canonical workflow: train → `torch.onnx.export` → run with ONNX Runtime.*
3. **Watch it explained** — [ONNX Explained with Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZtXdMao7Ic). *A quick, concrete walkthrough of what ONNX is and does.*
4. **Learn the runtime** — read the [ONNX Runtime docs](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/) and watch [Introduction to ONNX Runtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp5PaRpudlk). *The optimizations + execution providers are what make ONNX worth it in production.*
5. **Adapt a tutorial** — browse [onnx/tutorials](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials) for your framework. *Find the closest conversion example and adapt it.*
