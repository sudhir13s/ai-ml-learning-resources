# Pandas — DataFrames · ETL · Time Series
> The workhorse for tabular data in Python: the labeled `Series`/`DataFrame`, plus the loading,
> cleaning, joining, grouping, reshaping, and time-series tooling that turn raw files into
> model-ready datasets. If NumPy is the array, Pandas is the spreadsheet with superpowers.

**Why it matters:** the daily reality of ML work is data wrangling, and interviews probe it —
`groupby` semantics, merge/join types, `apply` vs vectorization, handling missing data, and
reshaping (pivot/melt). Fluency here is what makes the modeling part possible.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See the shape of it** — read [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html). *A fast, official tour of Series/DataFrame, selection, and the core verbs.*
2. **Build it by hand** — watch [Complete Pandas Data Science Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg) (Keith Galli). *Reading CSVs, filtering, and groupby typed out makes the API stick.*
3. **Work the official intro tutorials** — do the [Getting Started tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html). *Short, task-focused lessons (read data, select, plot, combine) from the maintainers.*
4. **Master groupby & reshaping** — study the [User Guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) sections on Group By, Merge/Join, and Reshaping. *These are the highest-leverage, most-interviewed operations.*
5. **Read it from the source** — work through the free [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Pandas' creator. *The definitive, idiomatic treatment of the library.*
