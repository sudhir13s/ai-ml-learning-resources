# PyTorch — Tensors · Autograd · nn · Training Loops
> The dominant research and production deep-learning framework: GPU-accelerated tensors with a
> NumPy-like API, reverse-mode autodiff (`autograd`), the `nn.Module` building blocks, and the
> explicit Python training loop that makes it easy to read, debug, and extend.

**Why it matters:** PyTorch is the default for modern DL and the framework most interviews assume —
explaining autograd and the computation graph, writing a correct training loop (`zero_grad` →
`forward` → `loss` → `backward` → `step`), the train/eval mode distinction, and moving tensors
between CPU/GPU. It is also the substrate for Hugging Face, Lightning, and most LLM code.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Do the 60-minute blitz** — [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html). *The official fast intro to tensors, autograd, and a first network.*
2. **Learn the basics properly** — work the [Learn the Basics](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) series. *A clean, modern path through datasets, models, autograd, and the training loop.*
3. **Build it end to end on video** — [PyTorch for Deep Learning — Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA) (Daniel Bourke / freeCodeCamp). *Watching the workflow built from scratch cements the training-loop pattern.*
4. **Understand autograd deeply** — focus on how `requires_grad`, `.backward()`, and the dynamic graph work (covered in the basics + [docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)). *Autograd is the most-asked PyTorch interview topic.*
5. **Go to mastery** — follow the free [Zero to Mastery PyTorch book/course](https://www.learnpytorch.io/). *A structured, project-driven path to real competence.*
