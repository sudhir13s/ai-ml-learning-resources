# NumPy — Arrays · Broadcasting · Vectorization
> The foundation of the entire Python scientific stack: a fast, contiguous N-dimensional array
> (`ndarray`) plus the vectorized math, broadcasting rules, and indexing that let you replace slow
> Python loops with C-speed operations. Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and JAX all stand on it.

**Why it matters:** almost every data/ML interview assumes NumPy fluency — broadcasting, views vs
copies, axis semantics, and "why is this loop slow?" Vectorized thinking is the mental model you carry
into every tensor library you'll ever use.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Get the mental model** — read the official [Absolute Beginner's Guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html). *The clearest from-zero intro to arrays, shapes, and indexing — written by the maintainers.*
2. **See it built live** — watch [Complete NumPy Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB9ByFAIAH4) (Keith Galli). *Watching arrays, slicing, and math typed out cements the syntax fast.*
3. **Internalize broadcasting & vectorization** — work the [Quickstart](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html), focusing on broadcasting and axis arguments. *This is the single idea that makes NumPy fast and the most-tested concept.*
4. **Go deeper, properly** — follow the [SciPy NumPy tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB7BZMhfPgk) (Enthought). *A rigorous treatment of memory layout, views, and dtype that explains the "why" behind performance.*
5. **Keep it as a reference** — bookmark the [API reference](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html) and the [official tutorials](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/). *You'll return to these constantly while building.*
