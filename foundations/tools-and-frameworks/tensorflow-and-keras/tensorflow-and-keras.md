# TensorFlow & Keras — Graphs · Layers · fit / serve
> Google's production-grade DL platform (**TensorFlow**) with **Keras** as its high-level API:
> stack layers, call `model.compile()` / `model.fit()`, and you have a trained model. TensorFlow
> adds graph execution (`tf.function`), `tf.data` pipelines, and a mature serving/mobile/edge stack
> (TF Serving, TFLite, TF.js).

**Why it matters:** Keras is the friendliest on-ramp to deep learning, and TensorFlow still powers
huge amounts of production ML. Interviews probe the Sequential vs Functional API, eager vs graph
execution (`@tf.function`), `tf.data` input pipelines, and how Keras `fit`/callbacks structure
training — plus the trade-offs vs PyTorch.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build a model in minutes** — read [Keras: Getting started](https://keras.io/getting_started/) and the [TF beginner quickstart](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials). *Keras' `Sequential` + `fit` gives a working classifier almost immediately.*
2. **Take the full course** — [TensorFlow 2.0 Complete Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk) (freeCodeCamp / Tim Ruscica). *A 7h end-to-end tour of TF + Keras for beginners.*
3. **Go deep on Keras** — [Keras with TensorFlow Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI) (freeCodeCamp). *Data prep, building/training nets, CNNs, transfer learning.*
4. **Learn the APIs that matter** — study the [Keras developer guides](https://keras.io/guides/) (Functional API, custom training, `tf.data`). *The Functional API and custom loops are the common interview/extension topics.*
5. **Keep references handy** — bookmark [TF tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) and [Keras examples](https://keras.io/examples/). *Adapting a near example is the real workflow.*
