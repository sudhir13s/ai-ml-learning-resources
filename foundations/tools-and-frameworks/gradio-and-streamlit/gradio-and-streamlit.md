# Gradio & Streamlit — Interactive ML Demos & Apps
> Two Python libraries that turn a model or script into a shareable web app with no front-end code.
> **Gradio** wraps any function in an input/output UI in a few lines (and powers Hugging Face
> Spaces) — perfect for model demos. **Streamlit** turns a Python script into a reactive data app
> with widgets, charts, and layout — perfect for dashboards and data tools.

**Why it matters:** being able to ship a demo is how ML work gets seen and used. Gradio is the
fastest path from model to an interactive, shareable demo (and the standard for HF Spaces);
Streamlit is the go-to for data dashboards. Both are common in portfolios and increasingly expected
for communicating results — knowing when to reach for each is the practical skill.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Ship a demo in 5 lines** — read the [Gradio Quickstart](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart). *Wrap a function in `gr.Interface` and you have a live UI immediately.*
2. **Watch it built** — [Gradio Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7CamOE-PA) (AssemblyAI). *Components, inputs/outputs, and sharing in one sitting.*
3. **Build a data app** — work the [Streamlit Get Started](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started). *The script-reruns-on-interaction model is Streamlit's whole mental model.*
4. **See Streamlit end to end** — [Streamlit Crash Course: From Zero to Data App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7fnzDQ5qM8) (Streamlit). *Widgets, layout, caching, and deploy.*
5. **Choose the right tool** — Gradio for model demos / HF Spaces, Streamlit for dashboards; browse the [Gradio guides](https://www.gradio.app/guides) and [Streamlit gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery). *Seeing real examples makes the choice obvious.*
