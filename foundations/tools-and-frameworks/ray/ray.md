# Ray — Distributed Training · Tuning · Serving
> A general-purpose framework for scaling Python from a laptop to a cluster with minimal code
> change: `@ray.remote` turns functions into parallel **tasks** and classes into stateful
> **actors**. On top of that core sit ML libraries — **Ray Train** (distributed training), **Ray
> Tune** (hyperparameter search), **Ray Serve** (model serving), **Ray Data**, and **RLlib**.

**Why it matters:** scaling out is unavoidable for large models and large sweeps, and Ray is the
most common Python-native way to do it. Interviews and real work touch on the tasks-vs-actors model,
why `ray.get` is blocking, how Ray Tune parallelizes hyperparameter search, and how Ray Train wraps
distributed data-parallel training without the usual boilerplate.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Run it locally** — read [Ray Getting Started](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/getting-started.html). *Install, then parallelize a function with `@ray.remote` — the core idea in minutes.*
2. **See the big picture** — [Ray: A Framework for Scaling Python & ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzt-CwohQC8) (Anyscale). *Where tasks, actors, and the ML libraries fit together.*
3. **Distribute training** — work the [Ray Train docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html) + [Ray Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmtyTb0eARo). *Distributed data-parallel training with little boilerplate is the highest-value use.*
4. **Parallelize tuning** — study [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) and watch [Scalable model training with Ray Tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAWUZJe571Y). *A distributed hyperparameter sweep in <10 lines is Ray's signature win.*
5. **Understand the architecture** — read the [Ray paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05889). *The tasks/actors execution model is what every interview probes.*
