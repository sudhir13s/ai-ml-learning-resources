# Matrices & Matrix Operations
> A matrix is a linear transformation written down as numbers: it stretches, rotates, projects, and
> mixes space. Multiplication is *composition* of those transformations; rank, inverse, and
> determinant tell you what the transformation keeps, destroys, or can undo. This is the literal
> arithmetic of every dense layer and attention block.

**Why it matters:** "what does this matrix do to space?" is the single most useful linear-algebra
question, and it powers interview staples — why `(AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ`, when an inverse exists, what rank
deficiency means for least squares, and why a layer `Wx + b` is just an affine map.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **See transformations** — watch [3B1B: Linear transformations & matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE), then [Matrix multiplication as composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkY2DOUCWMU). *The single best reframing: a matrix is a function on space, and multiplication is doing one after another.*
2. **Get the mechanics** — read [MML Ch. 2.2–2.3](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf) (matrix multiplication, inverse, transpose). *Locks in the algebra rules and when they apply.*
3. **Practice & extend** — do [Khan: Matrix transformations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations) (multiplication, inverse, determinant). *Build fluency with the operations you'll do by hand in interviews.*
4. **Determinant intuition** — watch [3B1B: The determinant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk). *Why determinant = signed volume scaling, and why det = 0 means non-invertible.*
5. **Connect to ML** — see matrices-as-maps in [ai-ml-intuitions 1.02 Dense Embeddings](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/representation/embedding-spaces/dense-embeddings-intuition). *A weight matrix is exactly this transformation.*
