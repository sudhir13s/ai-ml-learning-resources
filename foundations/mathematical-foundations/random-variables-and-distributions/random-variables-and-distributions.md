# Random Variables & Distributions
> A random variable maps outcomes to numbers; its distribution (PMF/PDF/CDF) says how probability
> is spread over those numbers. Knowing the workhorse distributions — Bernoulli, binomial, Gaussian,
> categorical, Poisson, exponential — and especially the (multivariate) Gaussian is the entry fee for
> probabilistic ML.

**Why it matters:** models *are* distributions — a classifier outputs a categorical, a VAE assumes
Gaussians, a language model factorizes a joint. Interviewers ask the difference between PMF/PDF/CDF,
the parameters and shape of the Gaussian, why the multivariate Gaussian's covariance matters, and
when to reach for which distribution.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **PMF/PDF/CDF** — watch [zedstatistics: Probability Distribution Functions (PMF, PDF, CDF)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLVjCKVP7U). *Nails the distinction people most often confuse.*
2. **Key discrete & continuous** — watch [3B1B: Binomial distributions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idr1WZ1A7Q) and [StatQuest: The Normal Distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzFX5NWojp0). *The two most-used families.*
3. **Formalize** — read [MML Ch. 6 (Probability & Distributions)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf), incl. the Gaussian and multivariate Gaussian. *Definitions, moments, and the Gaussian's role in ML.*
4. **Reference** — keep [CS229 Probability Review](https://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf) and [Stat 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) handy. *Distribution tables and properties.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 0.02 Distributions & the Gaussian](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/foundational-mental-models/probability-and-belief/distributions-and-gaussians-intuition.md). *Why Gaussians are everywhere in ML.*
