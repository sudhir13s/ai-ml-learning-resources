# Vectors & Vector Spaces
> A vector is both a list of numbers and an arrow in space; a vector space is the set of all such
> arrows you can scale and add. Span, linear independence, and basis are the vocabulary for "how
> many independent directions does my data really have?" — the foundation under embeddings,
> features, and every linear model.

**Why it matters:** every datapoint, embedding, and weight row is a vector. Interviewers probe
whether you understand span/basis/independence (e.g. "what does it mean for features to be linearly
dependent?", "what's the dimension of this column space?") because rank, collinearity, and
degrees-of-freedom arguments fall straight out of it.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Build geometric intuition** — watch [3Blue1Brown: Vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs) then [Linear combinations, span & basis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY). *See vectors as arrows and "span" as the region you can reach before any algebra.*
2. **Pin down the definitions** — read [MML Ch. 2.1–2.4](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf) (vector spaces, linear independence, basis & rank). *Turns the pictures into precise, exam-ready definitions.*
3. **Work problems** — do [Khan Academy: Vectors & spaces](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces). *Repetition on independence/span is what makes it stick.*
4. **Connect to ML** — read why features-as-vectors and span matter in [ai-ml-intuitions 1.01 One-Hot](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/representation/discrete-representations/one-hot-encoding-intuition). *Grounds the abstraction in real representation choices.*
