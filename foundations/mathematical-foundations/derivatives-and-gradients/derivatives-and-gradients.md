# Derivatives & Gradients
> A derivative is a local rate of change; a gradient bundles all the partial derivatives into the
> vector that points in the direction of steepest ascent. Every training step in ML is "compute the
> gradient of the loss, step against it" — so this is the most operationally important math you'll
> own.

**Why it matters:** gradients drive all of gradient-based learning. Interviewers check that you
know the gradient points uphill (so you descend against it), that it's perpendicular to level sets,
what a directional derivative is, and why a zero gradient marks a stationary point — the setup for
optimization.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Single-variable intuition** — watch [3B1B: The essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM) and [The paradox of the derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk). *Derivative as instantaneous rate, built from the ground up.*
2. **Go multivariable** — watch [Khan: Gradient and graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-02ze7tf08). *Partial derivatives → the gradient vector and why it points uphill.*
3. **Formalize** — read [MML Ch. 5 (Vector Calculus)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf), §5.1–5.3. *Partial derivatives, gradients, and gradient rules.*
4. **Reference & practice** — use [Paul's Online Notes: The Gradient Vector](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/GradientVector.aspx) and Khan exercises. *Solidify computation and the steepest-ascent property.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 2.01 Partial Derivatives & the Gradient](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/learning-and-optimization/gradients-and-credit-assignment/partial-derivatives-and-gradients-intuition.md). *Where the gradient becomes the training signal.*
