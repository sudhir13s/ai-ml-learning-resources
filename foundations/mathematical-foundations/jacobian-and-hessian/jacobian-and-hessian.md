# Jacobian & Hessian
> The **Jacobian** is the matrix of all first-order partials of a vector-valued function — the
> local linear map (and the object autograd multiplies in reverse mode). The **Hessian** is the
> matrix of second-order partials — local curvature, which tells you whether a critical point is a
> min, max, or saddle, and underlies Newton's method.

**Why it matters:** the Jacobian is how gradients propagate through vector functions (the "Jacobian
of the layer"); the Hessian governs curvature, conditioning, and second-order optimization.
Interviewers ask how the Jacobian relates to the chain rule, what a positive-definite Hessian
implies, why saddle points stall training, and what Newton's step does.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Jacobian intuition** — watch [Khan: The Jacobian matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohL918kXQk). *The Jacobian as the local linear approximation of a multivariable map.*
2. **Hessian & curvature** — watch [Khan: The Hessian matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbBcuZukCAw). *Second derivatives, curvature, and the second-derivative test.*
3. **Formalize** — read [MML Ch. 5.3–5.7 (Vector Calculus)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf): Jacobians, higher-order derivatives, Taylor. *The precise definitions and shapes.*
4. **Why it matters for optimization** — read [Boyd & Vandenberghe Ch. 9.5 (Newton's method)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf). *Where the Hessian becomes the step direction.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 2.03 Jacobian & Hessian](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/learning-and-optimization/gradients-and-credit-assignment/jacobians-and-hessians-intuition.md). *How both show up in training and curvature analysis.*
