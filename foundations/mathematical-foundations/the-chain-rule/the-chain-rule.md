# The Chain Rule (& Backpropagation)
> The chain rule differentiates a composition: the rate of change of `f(g(x))` is the product of
> the local rates. Stack it across the layers of a network and you get backpropagation — the
> reverse-mode accumulation of gradients that makes deep learning trainable at all.

**Why it matters:** backprop *is* the multivariable chain rule applied over a computational graph.
Interviewers ask you to differentiate composed functions by hand, explain forward vs reverse mode
(why reverse is cheap for scalar losses), and derive the gradient through a small network — all
chain rule.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Single-variable chain rule** — watch [3B1B: Visualizing the chain rule and product rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG15m2VwSjA). *See where the product of derivatives comes from.*
2. **From chain rule to backprop** — watch [3B1B: Backpropagation, intuitively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) then [Backpropagation calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8). *The exact moment the chain rule becomes a learning algorithm.*
3. **Build it yourself** — watch [Karpathy: micrograd — the spelled-out intro to backprop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0). *Implementing reverse-mode autodiff cements it forever.*
4. **Matrix/vector form** — read [Matrix Calculus for Deep Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/). *The vector chain rule and Jacobian-product view used in real frameworks.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 2.02 Backpropagation (The Chain Rule)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/learning-and-optimization/gradients-and-credit-assignment/chain-rule-and-backpropagation-intuition). *The platform's deep dive on credit assignment.*
