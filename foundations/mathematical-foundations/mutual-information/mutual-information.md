# Mutual Information
> Mutual information `I(X;Y) = H(X) − H(X|Y)` measures how much knowing one variable reduces
> uncertainty about another — the information they *share*. It's symmetric, non-negative, and zero
> exactly when the variables are independent, which makes it the principled measure of dependence
> behind feature selection, representation learning (InfoNCE), and decision-tree splits.

**Why it matters:** MI generalizes correlation to *any* (including nonlinear) dependence, so it
appears in feature selection, the information-bottleneck view of deep nets, and contrastive
objectives (InfoNCE lower-bounds MI). Interviewers ask how MI relates to entropy and KL, why it's
zero under independence, and where it shows up in modern representation learning.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Definition & intuition** — watch [Ben Lambert: An introduction to mutual information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9h1xkNELvY). *MI as the reduction in uncertainty, with the entropy diagram.*
2. **From entropy/KL** — watch [Aurélien Géron: Entropy, Cross-Entropy and KL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErfnhcEV1O8) and note `I(X;Y) = D(p(x,y)‖p(x)p(y))`. *MI is the KL between joint and product-of-marginals.*
3. **Formalize** — read [Cover & Thomas Ch. 2 (Entropy, Relative Entropy & Mutual Information)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vh/courses/LexicalSemantics/Association/Cover&Thomas-Ch2.pdf). *The definitions, chain rules, and the data-processing inequality.*
4. **Modern ML use** — read [Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding (InfoNCE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748). *How MI maximization drives self-supervised representations.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 5.01 Information Theory: Entropy & KL](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/foundational-mental-models/information-and-dependence/entropy-and-kl-divergence-intuition.md) and [1.13 Contrastive Learning (SimCLR/InfoNCE)](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/representation/representation-learning/contrastive-learning-intuition.md). *Where MI becomes a training objective.*
