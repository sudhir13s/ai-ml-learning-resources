# Law of Large Numbers & the Central Limit Theorem
> The **Law of Large Numbers** says sample averages converge to the true mean as you collect more
> data; the **Central Limit Theorem** says those averages are approximately Gaussian regardless of
> the original distribution. Together they justify estimation from samples, mini-batch gradients,
> bootstrap, and the ubiquity of the normal distribution.

**Why it matters:** these two theorems are *why* sampling works. Interviewers ask why mini-batch
gradients are unbiased estimates that converge, why confidence intervals shrink like `1/√n`, why so
many quantities end up Gaussian, and the difference between the LLN (the mean) and the CLT (the
*distribution* of the mean).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **LLN intuition** — watch [Khan: Law of large numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpuN8vCQ--M). *Sample averages settling onto the true mean.*
2. **CLT, visually** — watch [3B1B: But what is the Central Limit Theorem?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeJD6dqJ5lo). *Why sums/averages become Gaussian, beautifully animated.*
3. **CLT, worked** — watch [StatQuest: The Central Limit Theorem, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAlJCEDH2uY). *A concrete numeric demonstration.*
4. **Formalize** — read the limit-theorems chapter of [Stat 110 / Blitzstein & Hwang](http://probabilitybook.net/). *Statements, conditions, and the `1/√n` scaling.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 0.04 Law of Large Numbers & CLT](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/foundational-mental-models/probability-and-belief/law-of-large-numbers-and-central-limit-theorem-intuition). *Why mini-batch estimates work.*
