# Lagrange Multipliers & Constrained Optimization
> To optimize subject to constraints, look for points where the objective's gradient is parallel to
> the constraints' gradients — the multipliers measure "how hard each constraint pushes back." This
> generalizes (via KKT conditions) to inequality constraints and is the machinery behind SVMs, PCA's
> variance-maximization, and constrained maximum-likelihood.

**Why it matters:** Lagrangians are how constrained problems become unconstrained ones, and KKT
conditions characterize their solutions. Interviewers ask you to set up the Lagrangian (e.g. derive
the SVM dual, or PCA as maximizing variance subject to `‖w‖=1`), interpret the multipliers, and
state the KKT conditions.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Geometric intuition** — watch [Khan: Lagrange multipliers via tangency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuqB-d5MjZA). *The "gradients align at the optimum" picture, which is the whole idea.*
2. **A worked example** — watch [Dr. Trefor Bazett: Lagrange Multipliers — geometric meaning & full example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mjcnxGMwFo). *Solve a constrained problem end to end.*
3. **Formalize equality + inequality (KKT)** — read [Boyd & Vandenberghe Ch. 5 (Duality)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf). *The Lagrangian, dual function, and KKT conditions — the rigorous core.*
4. **ML connection** — read MML Ch. 7.2 (Constrained Optimization & Lagrange Multipliers). *Constrained optimization scoped for ML, with the SVM as motivation.*
5. **See it in action** — note how PCA (maximize variance s.t. unit norm) and the hard-margin SVM dual both fall out of a Lagrangian. *These are the canonical interview applications.*
