# Bayesian Inference — priors, posteriors, MAP
> Bayesian inference treats parameters as *random* and updates a prior into a posterior with data:
> `posterior ∝ likelihood × prior`. The **MAP** estimate is the posterior's peak; full Bayes keeps
> the whole posterior to quantify uncertainty. This is the basis for regularization-as-priors,
> Bayesian models, and the ELBO behind VAEs.

**Why it matters:** the MLE-vs-MAP-vs-full-Bayes distinction is a frequent interview topic, as is
"L2 regularization = Gaussian prior" and "L1 = Laplace prior." You should derive a posterior for a
simple model (e.g. Beta–Binomial), explain conjugacy, and articulate when uncertainty (full
posterior) matters versus a point estimate.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **The mindset** — watch [StataCorp: Introduction to Bayesian statistics, part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F0QoMCSKJ4) and revisit [3B1B: Bayes' theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM). *Priors → posteriors as belief updating.*
2. **MLE vs MAP vs Bayes** — read [MML Ch. 8.3–8.4 (MLE, MAP, Bayesian inference)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf). *The three estimators and where the prior enters.*
3. **A worked posterior** — read [Think Bayes Ch. 1–3](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/) (Beta–Binomial, conjugacy). *Compute a posterior in Python end to end.*
4. **Regularization as a prior** — connect L2/L1 penalties to Gaussian/Laplace priors (covered in CS229 / MML). *The cleanest "why does regularization work" answer.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 5.02 Latent-Variable Models (ELBO/VAEs)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/generation/latent-variable-generation/latent-variable-models-and-elbo-intuition). *Where Bayesian inference scales to deep generative models.*
