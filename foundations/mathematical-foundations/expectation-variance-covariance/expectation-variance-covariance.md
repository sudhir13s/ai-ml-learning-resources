# Expectation, Variance & Covariance
> Expectation is the probability-weighted average (the "center"); variance measures spread;
> covariance measures how two variables move together, and the covariance matrix packages all
> pairwise covariances. These moments are the summary statistics behind loss functions, the
> bias–variance tradeoff, PCA, and the multivariate Gaussian.

**Why it matters:** expectation linearity, variance of sums, and the covariance matrix come up
constantly — from "why does averaging gradients reduce variance" to deriving PCA from the covariance
matrix to the bias–variance decomposition. Interviewers expect fluency with `E`, `Var`, `Cov`, and
their algebra (e.g. `Var(X) = E[X²] − E[X]²`).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Expectation** — watch [StatQuest: Expected Values, Main Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLs_7b7SKi4). *The probability-weighted-average intuition.*
2. **Variance & covariance** — watch [StatQuest: Covariance, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtaqvPAeEJY). *How covariance encodes co-movement (and its sign).*
3. **The covariance matrix** — watch [ritvikmath: The Covariance Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=152tSYtiQbw). *The object PCA and the multivariate Gaussian are built on.*
4. **Formalize** — read [MML Ch. 6.4 (Summary Statistics & Independence)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf). *Moments, covariance, and their algebra.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 0.03 Expectation, Variance, Covariance](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/foundational-mental-models/probability-and-belief/expectation-variance-and-covariance-intuition.md). *Where moments power ML reasoning.*
