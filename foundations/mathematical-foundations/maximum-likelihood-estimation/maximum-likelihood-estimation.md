# Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
> MLE picks the parameters that make the observed data most probable: maximize the likelihood
> (usually the log-likelihood). It's the principle that *derives* most ML loss functions — squared
> error falls out of a Gaussian likelihood, cross-entropy out of a categorical/Bernoulli one — so it
> unifies "why this loss?" across models.

**Why it matters:** "derive the loss from a likelihood" is a top-tier ML interview move. You should
show that least squares = Gaussian MLE, logistic regression's loss = Bernoulli MLE, and softmax
cross-entropy = categorical MLE — and explain why we maximize the *log*-likelihood and how MLE
relates to MAP (add a prior).

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Likelihood ≠ probability** — watch [StatQuest: Probability is not Likelihood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYxNSUDSFH4). *Clears up the single most common confusion before any math.*
2. **The method** — watch [StatQuest: Maximum Likelihood, clearly explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XepXtl9YKwc). *Set up the likelihood, take logs, differentiate, solve.*
3. **Derive ML losses** — read [CS229 Lecture notes 1 (GLMs / MLE)](https://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2021fall/cs229-notes1.pdf). *Least squares and logistic regression *as* MLE — the key interview connection.*
4. **Formalize** — read [MML Ch. 8.3 (Parameter Estimation: MLE & MAP)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf). *MLE, MAP, and where the prior enters.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 3.04 Maximum Likelihood Estimation](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/objectives-and-evaluation/statistical-objectives/maximum-likelihood-intuition.md). *The platform's deep dive, tying MLE to cross-entropy.*
