# Cross-Entropy & KL Divergence — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Cross-Entropy & KL Divergence](cross-entropy-and-kl-divergence.md)**
> (the concept page). Kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by
> type, best-first. Everything here is **free / open** — no paywall. Every source cited under a
> "Source / derivation" line on the concept page appears here, so each formula is traceable to a
> primary source. Chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Get the picture** — read [Visual Information Theory](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/) (**Christopher Olah**). *The definitive free visual treatment of entropy → cross-entropy → KL as code lengths — the coding intuition this chapter is built on.*
2. **The bridge, fast** — watch [A Short Introduction to Entropy, Cross-Entropy and KL-Divergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErfnhcEV1O8) (**Aurélien Géron**). *All three quantities and how they relate, in ten minutes.*
3. **Cross-entropy as a loss** — watch [Neural Networks Part 6: Cross Entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArSys5qHAU) (**StatQuest**). *Exactly how cross-entropy is used to train a classifier.*
4. **KL intuition & asymmetry** — watch [Intuitively Understanding the KL Divergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxGYPqCgJWM) (**Adian Liusie**). *Why KL measures distributional distance and why it's asymmetric.*
5. **The math + MLE link** — read [MML Ch. 8 (MLE ↔ cross-entropy)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf) and [MacKay Ch. 2 (relative entropy, Gibbs)](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf). *Minimising cross-entropy = maximising likelihood = minimising KL.*

- Prerequisite (the *why* behind bits and surprise): [22 Entropy](../entropy/entropy.md)
- The unifying theorem it rests on: [19 Maximum Likelihood Estimation](../maximum-likelihood-estimation/maximum-likelihood-estimation.md) (minimising cross-entropy = MLE)
- Where it goes next: [24 Mutual Information](../mutual-information/mutual-information.md) — $I(X;Y) = D_{KL}(\text{joint}\,\|\,\text{product of marginals})$, KL applied to dependence
