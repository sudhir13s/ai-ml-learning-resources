# Convexity & Convex Functions
> A set is convex if the line between any two of its points stays inside it; a function is convex
> if it sits below its chords (equivalently, its Hessian is positive semidefinite). Convexity is
> the property that makes optimization *easy* — any local minimum is global — which is why so much
> ML theory is framed around it.

**Why it matters:** convexity is the dividing line between "guaranteed-solvable" (linear/logistic
regression, SVMs, LASSO) and "no global guarantees" (deep nets). Interviewers ask whether a loss is
convex, how to prove convexity (PSD Hessian, Jensen's inequality, composition rules), and why
convexity guarantees a unique global optimum.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **What & why** — watch [Visually Explained: Convexity & Duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0CF3d5aEGc) and [What is Mathematical Optimization?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM6BY4btj-M). *The geometric "below-the-chord" picture and why it matters.*
2. **The definitions** — read [Boyd & Vandenberghe Ch. 2 (Convex Sets) & Ch. 3 (Convex Functions)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf). *The canonical free source: convex sets/functions, first- and second-order conditions.*
3. **The full course** — watch [Stephen Boyd: Convex Optimization I, Lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLq1hEq3UY). *Boyd's own framing of why convexity is the key dividing line.*
4. **ML connection** — read MML Ch. 7 (Continuous Optimization). *Convexity, gradient descent, and constrained problems in an ML context.*
5. **Tie to losses** — note which ML losses are convex in their parameters (linear/logistic regression, SVM hinge) vs not (neural nets). *This framing recurs in interviews.*
