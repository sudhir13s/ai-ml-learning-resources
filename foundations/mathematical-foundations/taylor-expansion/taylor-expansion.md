# Taylor Expansion
> A Taylor expansion approximates a function near a point by a polynomial built from its
> derivatives there: value + slope·Δ + ½·curvature·Δ² + …. It's the lens through which optimization
> "sees" the loss locally — gradient descent uses the first-order term, Newton's method the
> second-order (Hessian) term.

**Why it matters:** the first- and second-order Taylor expansions are the formal justification for
gradient descent and Newton's method, and they underpin convergence analysis and curvature
arguments. Interviewers ask you to write the quadratic Taylor model of a loss and read off the
optimal step — pure Taylor.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Intuition** — watch [3B1B: Taylor series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4). *Why successive derivatives reconstruct a function, with the best visual treatment available.*
2. **Single-variable formalism** — read [Paul's Online Notes: Taylor Series](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/TaylorSeries.aspx). *The expansion, remainder term, and worked examples.*
3. **Multivariable + the quadratic model** — read [MML Ch. 5.8 (Linearization & Multivariate Taylor)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf). *The gradient + Hessian quadratic form used in optimization.*
4. **See it drive optimization** — read [Boyd & Vandenberghe Ch. 9.5 (Newton's method)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf). *The second-order Taylor model is exactly the Newton step.*
