# Hypothesis Testing & Confidence Intervals
> A hypothesis test asks "could this result be chance?" — a p-value is the probability of data this
> extreme under the null. A confidence interval reports a range of plausible values with a stated
> coverage. Together they're how you decide whether a model improvement, an A/B test, or a metric
> difference is *real*.

**Why it matters:** comparing models honestly is a core ML-engineering skill, and A/B-test
reasoning shows up in interviews. You should explain what a p-value does (and does *not*) mean,
Type I vs Type II error and power, what "95% confidence" actually claims, and why multiple
comparisons inflate false positives.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Hypothesis tests & null** — watch [StatQuest: Hypothesis Testing & the Null Hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oc49DyA3hU). *The framework before any formulas.*
2. **p-values, correctly** — watch [StatQuest: p-values, what they are and how to interpret them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vemZtEM63GY). *Kills the most common misinterpretation.*
3. **Confidence intervals** — watch [StatQuest: Confidence Intervals, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqOeMYtOc1w). *What the interval does and doesn't say.*
4. **Formalize** — read [OpenStax Introductory Statistics — Hypothesis Testing & CIs](https://openstax.org/books/introductory-statistics/pages/9-introduction). *Test statistics, errors, power, and interval construction.*
5. **Connect to ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 0.05 Hypothesis Testing & Confidence Intervals](/ai-ml/ai-ml-intuitions/foundational-mental-models/probability-and-belief/hypothesis-testing-and-confidence-intuition). *Evaluating model comparisons honestly.*
