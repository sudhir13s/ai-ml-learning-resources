# Gradient Descent — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Gradient Descent — theory & convergence](gradient-descent-theory.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Intuition** — watch [Gradient Descent, Step-by-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDv4f4s2SB8) (**StatQuest**) and [how neural networks learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w) (**3Blue1Brown**). *The "roll downhill" picture and the role of the step size.*
2. **The update & batch vs stochastic** — read [CS231n Optimization notes](https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/). *Full-batch, mini-batch, and SGD, with practical step-size guidance.*
3. **Feel the conditioning** — play with [Why Momentum Really Works](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) (**Distill**). *Dial the condition number and watch the zig-zag.*
4. **The convergence theory** — read [Boyd & Vandenberghe Ch. 9](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf). *Step-size rules, convex/smooth convergence, conditioning.*
5. **Why SGD works** — read [Bottou, Curtis & Nocedal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04838). *The rigorous treatment of stochastic-gradient convergence.*

**Videos**:
