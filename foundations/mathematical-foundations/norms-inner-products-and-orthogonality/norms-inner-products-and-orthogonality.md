# Norms, Inner Products & Orthogonality
> The inner (dot) product measures *alignment*; a norm measures *length*; orthogonality means
> "no shared direction." Together they give geometry to vector spaces — angles, distances,
> projections — which is exactly what cosine similarity, L1/L2 regularization, least squares, and
> attention's scaled dot-product are built from.

**Why it matters:** the dot product is the most-used operation in ML. Interviewers ask why cosine
similarity divides out magnitude, the difference between L1 and L2 norms (and why one induces
sparsity), what an orthogonal matrix preserves, and why attention scales `QKᵀ` by `1/√d`. All of it
is inner-products and norms.

**⭐ Start here — suggested path:**

1. **Dot product, geometrically** — watch [3B1B: Dot products and duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0). *Why `a·b` relates to projection and angle, not just a sum of products.*
2. **Norms & distances in ML** — read [ai-ml-intuitions 1.07–1.08 Euclidean vs Cosine](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/representation/similarity-and-distance/cosine-vs-euclidean-distance-intuition.md) and [1.09 Manhattan/L1](../../../../ai-ml-intuitions/representation/similarity-and-distance/manhattan-distance-intuition.md). *The exact place these definitions get used.*
3. **Formalize it** — read [MML Ch. 3 (Analytic Geometry)](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf): inner products, norms, orthogonality, projections. *Definitions and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality you'll quote.*
4. **Orthogonality & projection** — watch [MIT 18.06: Orthogonal Vectors & Subspaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzZUIYRCE38). *Sets up least squares = projection onto a subspace.*
5. **Practice** — do [Khan: Projections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27vT-NWuw0M) and norm exercises. *Cement projection formulas and L1/L2 mechanics.*
