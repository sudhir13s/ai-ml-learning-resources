"""Shared import bootstrap for the LLM figure/animation generators that live in tools/.

The figure/animation generators were moved out of each topic's reader-facing ``code/`` dir into
this shared ``tools/`` dir (so the app's code viewer shows only the teaching demo + notebook, not
the build tooling). Many generators still import their topic's demo module (e.g.
``decoding_sampling``, ``rlhf_dpo``) and their sibling generator (``make_figures_NN``). Importing
this module first puts every LLM topic ``code/`` dir — and ``tools/`` itself — on ``sys.path`` so
those imports resolve from the new location:

    import _pathsetup  # noqa: F401  (sys.path bootstrap; must precede topic-module imports)
    from _pathsetup import topic_images

Since the chartered restructure every topic owns its figures, so there is no shared image dir
any more. ``topic_images("inference-and-serving/kv-cache")`` returns
the ``images`` dir of one topic package; each generator names its own.
