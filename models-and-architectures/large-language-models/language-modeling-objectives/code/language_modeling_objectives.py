"""Language modeling objectives, from scratch: cross-entropy by hand, then watch a tiny LM learn.

Three self-contained demos that make the causal language-modeling objective concrete:
  1. Cross-entropy and perplexity computed BY HAND on one toy prediction, so the arithmetic
     is checkable against -log(p) and exp(loss).
  2. The causal mask printed as a lower-triangular matrix -- position t may not see the future.
  3. A tiny causal LM trained a few steps so loss and perplexity visibly DROP toward their
     floor (~1.0 when memorizing a single sentence), which is maximum likelihood at work.

This is the same verified demo embedded in the concept page and the teaching notebook.
Verified on Python 3.12 / torch 2.x. Device-agnostic (CUDA / MPS / CPU); the by-hand numbers
are exact on any device; the training curve drops toward its floor the same way everywhere
(the exact mid-curve digits are device-dependent, so the trace is run on CPU).
