"""In-context learning, from scratch: make ICL concrete, measured, and reproducible.

This is the single source of truth for every number quoted on the concept page, in the
teaching notebook, and in the figures. It runs three self-contained experiments on a tiny
from-scratch transformer -- NO pretrained weights, NO internet -- each proving one claim that
the page makes in prose:

  1. INDUCTION (the mechanism behind few-shot copying). Train a 2-layer attention-only
     transformer on a synthetic "in-context recall" task: sequences where the token after a
     repeated symbol must be copied from its earlier occurrence (... A B ... A -> B). The
     model learns an INDUCTION HEAD -- an attention pattern that, at the second A, looks back
     to the token right after the first A and copies it. We then read the head's attention
     weights and SHOW the look-back. This is Olsson et al.'s induction head, in miniature.

  2. FEW-SHOT > ZERO-SHOT. On a fresh held-out alphabet the model has NEVER been trained on,
     measure next-token accuracy as a function of k = number of in-context demonstrations of
     the rule. Zero-shot (k=0) is at chance; accuracy climbs as k grows -- the model infers
     the task FROM THE PROMPT, with no weight updates. We assert few-shot(k>=1) > zero-shot.

  3. SENSITIVITY (ICL is brittle). Hold k fixed but PERMUTE the order of the in-context
     demonstrations and measure how much the prediction swings. We assert the swing is real
     (the spread across permutations is non-trivial), making "ICL is order-sensitive"
     measured, not asserted.

DEVICE HONESTY: the model is tiny, so the reproducible run is pinned to CPU. We still detect
the best available accelerator and print it honestly -- "device: cpu (detected mps; pinned to
CPU for reproducibility)" -- because seeded cross-device float math drifts and would break the
page == notebook == .py == figures contract. Every asserted result is checked BEFORE any
timing.
