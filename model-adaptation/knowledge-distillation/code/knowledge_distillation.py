"""From-scratch knowledge distillation: see the dark knowledge, then prove KD beats hard-only.

Three things, end to end, on a tiny synthetic classification task:

  1. SOFT TARGETS -- print one teacher distribution at T=1 vs T=4 so the "dark knowledge"
     (the off-target probability mass on similar classes) becomes visible.
  2. THE KD LOSS -- implement L = alpha * T^2 * KL(teacher_T || student_T) + (1-alpha) * CE,
     with the temperature division, the KL term, and the T^2 rescale each commented inline.
  3. THE PAYOFF -- train a student two ways (hard-labels-only vs KD) from the SAME init and
     show the KD student agrees with the teacher MORE (assert KD agreement >= hard-only).

Correctness (the dark-knowledge print and the agreement assert) is established before any
timing. Device-agnostic (CUDA / MPS / CPU): the device is DETECTED, but the reproducible
training run is PINNED to CPU and the print says so honestly -- the small nets and fixed seed
make CPU both fast and deterministic. The same verified code lives in the teaching notebook.

Verified on Python 3.12 / torch 2.x.

Run:
