# Contrastive / Self-Supervised Learning — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Contrastive / Self-Supervised Learning](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/self-supervised-learning/contrastive-self-supervised-learning/contrastive-self-supervised-learning)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations — SimCLR (paper illustrated)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgeWsuyRH8) (**Yannic Kilcher**). *Augment one image two ways → make those embeddings agree, everything else disagree.*
2. **See the framework + code** — watch [Tutorial 17: Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning with SimCLR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waVZDFR-06U) (**Phillip Lippe, UvA**). *The encoder + projection head + NT-Xent pipeline, built in a runnable notebook.*
3. **Get the loss + the whole family** — read [Contrastive Representation Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive/) (**Lilian Weng**). *InfoNCE, SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, SimSiam, and the collapse problem — the single best written survey.*
4. **Read the sources** — [SimCLR (Chen et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) and [InfoNCE / CPC (Oord et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748). *The framework, and the loss the field standardized on.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work the [Illustrated SimCLR](https://amitness.com/2020/03/illustrated-simclr/) walkthrough and the [UvA SimCLR notebook](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial17/SimCLR.html). *Coding the augmentations + NT-Xent loss cements it.*
