# Backpropagation & Computational Graphs — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Backpropagation & Computational Graphs](backpropagation-and-computational-graphs.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Backpropagation, intuitively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) (**3Blue1Brown**). *Gradients as "nudges" to weights, before any symbols.*
2. **See why it works** — read [Calculus on Computational Graphs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) (**Chris Olah**). *The clearest explanation of why reverse mode gets all derivatives in one pass.*
3. **Get the math** — watch [Backpropagation calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8) (**3Blue1Brown**) + read [CS231n: Backprop](https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/). *The chain rule on a graph, with the local-gradient bookkeeping.*
4. **Read the source** — [Learning representations by back-propagating errors](https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0) (**Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986**). *The paper that popularized backprop.*
5. **Make it concrete** — build it from scratch with [Karpathy's micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0), then map it to [PyTorch autograd](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html). *Implementing a tiny autograd engine makes the graph + chain rule click permanently.*
