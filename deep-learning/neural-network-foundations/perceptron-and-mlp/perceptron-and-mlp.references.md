# Perceptron and MLP — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Perceptron and MLP](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/neural-network-foundations/perceptron-and-mlp/perceptron-and-mlp)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author (the original papers) or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [But what is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) (**3Blue1Brown**). *See neurons, weights, and layers as a function before any math.*
2. **See the limit, then the fix** — play with [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/). *Watch a linear model fail on XOR, add one hidden layer + a nonlinearity, and watch it separate the classes — block 2 vs block 3 of the page, animated.*
3. **Read it from first principles** — [Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Ch. 1](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) (**Nielsen**). *Perceptrons → sigmoid neurons → a working MLP, derived gently.*
4. **See universal approximation visually** — [A Visual Proof that Neural Nets Can Compute Any Function](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) (**Nielsen**). *The bump-construction proof, interactive.*
5. **Go to the source** — read [the perceptron and its learning rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) (**Rosenblatt 1958**, summarized with the original citation) and the [XOR limitation in *Perceptrons*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book)) (**Minsky & Papert 1969**). *The work that started — and nearly ended — the field.*
