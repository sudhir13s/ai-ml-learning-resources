# RNN / LSTM / GRU — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[RNN / LSTM / GRU](rnn-lstm-gru.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [RNNs, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsNTP8Kwu80) (**StatQuest**), then read [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) (**Karpathy**). *What a hidden state does and what RNNs can generate.*
2. **See why LSTMs work** — read [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) (**Chris Olah**), the canonical gate diagrams. *The clearest picture of the cell state and the three gates.*
3. **Get the math** — [LSTM, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCzL96nL7j0) (**StatQuest**) + [d2l Ch. 9–10](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-neural-networks/index.html). *BPTT, gradient flow through the cell state, and the gate equations.*
4. **Read the sources** — [LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997)](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F23/document/readings/LSTM.pdf) → [GRU (Cho et al. 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078) → [empirical comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555).
5. **Make it concrete** — implement an RNN/LSTM with [d2l Ch. 10](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-modern/lstm.html), then see the modern recurrent revival in [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752).
