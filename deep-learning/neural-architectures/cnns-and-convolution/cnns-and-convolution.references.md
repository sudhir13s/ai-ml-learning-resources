# CNNs & Convolution — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[CNNs & Convolution](cnns-and-convolution.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is free / open (no paywall) and from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [But what is a convolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA) (**3Blue1Brown**), then play with [CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/). *See the operation, then watch real feature maps light up interactively.*
2. **See it step by step** — [Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGwBXDKFk9I) (**StatQuest, Josh Starmer**). *Filters and pooling, one gentle step at a time.*
3. **Get the math** — [CS231n notes: Convolutional Networks](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/), then the [guide to convolution arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285) for stride/pad/dilation/transposed shapes. *Output-size arithmetic, parameter counts, and every variant's geometry.*
4. **Read the sources** — [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf) → [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) → [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) → [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). *The progression that made CNNs deep and dominant.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run this chapter's [notebook](code/cnns-and-convolution.ipynb) (from-scratch conv forward *and* backward, verified), then work through [d2l Ch. 7 (CNNs)](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-neural-networks/index.html). *Implementing conv/pool layers cements the dimensions and gradients.*
