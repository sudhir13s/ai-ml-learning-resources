# Dropout — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Dropout](dropout.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. Every link verified (HTTP 200).

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Dropout Regularization (C2W1L06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8PJAL-MZv8) (**Andrew Ng**). *Why randomly killing units spreads out the learned weights.*
2. **See why it works** — watch [Understanding Dropout (C2W1L07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARq74QuavAo) (**Andrew Ng**). *The ensemble / no-co-adaptation argument, intuitively.*
3. **Get the math and run it** — read & run [d2l: Dropout](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/dropout.html). *Inverted dropout, expectations, and from-scratch code.*
4. **Read the source** — [Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Overfitting](https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html) (**Srivastava et al. 2014**). *The canonical paper, with the model-averaging derivation.*
5. **Go deeper on the theory** — [Dropout Training as Adaptive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0543) (**Wager et al. 2013**). *Dropout as an adaptive $L_2$ penalty — the connection to weight decay.*
6. **Make it concrete** — toggle `nn.Dropout(p)` on a small over-fitting net and watch the train/val gap close (and sweep `p` to find the sweet spot).
