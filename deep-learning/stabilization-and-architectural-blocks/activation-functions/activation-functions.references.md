# Activation Functions — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Activation Functions](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/stabilization-and-architectural-blocks/activation-functions/activation-functions)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first within each group. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [ReLU In Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68BZ5f7P94E) (**StatQuest**). *See how a piecewise-linear unit bends a function to fit, then combines with others.*
2. **Survey the zoo** — read [Activation Functions in Neural Networks](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/neural-networks-activation-functions/) (**Jeremy Jordan**), then toggle the Activation dropdown in [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/). *The functions side by side, then watch Linear vs ReLU carve a boundary live.*
3. **Get the math** — read [CS231n: Commonly used activation functions](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/). *Saturation, the dead-ReLU problem, zero-centering, and how to choose.*
4. **Understand softmax** — read [Softmax from scratch](https://e2eml.school/softmax.html) (**Brandon Rohrer**). *Why softmax exponentiates-and-normalizes, and its Jacobian.*
5. **Read the modern sources** — skim [GELU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415), [Swish/SiLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941), and [GLU Variants (SwiGLU)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202). *The smooth and gated activations behind transformers and modern LLMs.*
