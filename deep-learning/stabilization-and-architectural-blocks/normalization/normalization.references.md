# Normalization — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Normalization](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/stabilization-and-architectural-blocks/normalization/normalization)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Normalizing Activations in a Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNIpEZLv_eg) (**Andrew Ng**). *Why centering/scaling activations stabilizes training.*
2. **See the variants** — watch [All About Normalizations — Batch, Layer, Instance, Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JmZ5idFcVI) (**ChiDotPhi**). *Exactly which axes each norm reduces over.*
3. **Get the math** — read [Understanding the backward pass through Batch Norm](https://kratzert.github.io/2016/02/12/understanding-the-gradient-flow-through-the-batch-normalization-layer.html) (**Kratzert**). *The full forward + backward derivation.*
4. **Read the sources** — [BatchNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) → [LayerNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) → [GroupNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494) → [RMSNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467). *In order; note what each changes.*
5. **Make it concrete** — implement BatchNorm forward/backward following [d2l §8.5](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/batch-norm.html). *Coding the running stats clarifies the train/eval split.*
