# Residual / Skip Connections — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Residual / Skip Connections](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/stabilization-and-architectural-blocks/residual-skip-connections/residual-skip-connections)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Why ResNets Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYth6EbBUqM) (**Andrew Ng**). *Why adding the input back makes deeper strictly safe.*
2. **See the gradient highway** — read & run [d2l: Residual Networks (ResNet)](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/resnet.html). *How the identity branch preserves gradient flow, with runnable code.*
3. **Get the math** — read [Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027) (**He et al. 2016**). *The $x_L = x_l + \sum F$ derivation and why a clean identity path is optimal.*
4. **Read the source** — [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (**He et al. 2015**). *The paper; the degradation problem and the fix.*
5. **See the deeper picture** — read [Residual Networks Behave Like Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06431) (**Veit et al. 2016**). *The unraveled $2^n$-path view.*
6. **Make it concrete** — implement a residual block following [d2l ResNet](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/resnet.html).
