# Deep Learning
> Neural networks that learn hierarchical representations from data — the engine behind modern
> vision, language, and generative AI. This is the curated shortlist of the *best free* resources;
> for the math intuition behind each idea, see the platform links at the bottom.

**⭐ Start here:** [Neural Networks — 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) for intuition, then [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero — Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) to build one from scratch.

## 📑 Concept Index
Every chapter is a self-contained folder (`NN-Concept/NN-Concept.md`) with its page and a curated
`.references.md` resource card (free, open courses · videos · papers · articles · books · cross-links).
> **✅ ready.** New to deep learning? Start with the field overview below, then work top to bottom.
