# Weight Initialization — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Weight Initialization](weight-initialization.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Weight Initialization (C2W1L11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2coXdufOzE) (**Andrew Ng**). *Why variance scaling keeps signals alive through depth.*
2. **See it interactively** — open [Initializing neural networks](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/initialization/index.html) (**DeepLearning.AI**). *Sliders show too-small/too-large init collapsing or exploding activations live.*
3. **Get the math** — read [How to initialize deep neural networks: Xavier and Kaiming](https://pouannes.github.io/blog/initialization/) (**Pierre Ouannes**). *Full variance derivation for both schemes.*
4. **Read the sources** — [Glorot & Bengio (Xavier)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) → [He et al. (Kaiming, for ReLU)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852). *The two papers everyone cites.*
5. **Make it concrete** — work through [d2l: Numerical Stability and Initialization](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/numerical-stability-and-init.html), then see how the residual/transformer tricks ([Fixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09321)) extend it to very deep nets.
