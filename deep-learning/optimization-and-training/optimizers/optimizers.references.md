# Optimizers — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Optimizers](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/optimization-and-training/optimizers/optimizers)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **See gradient descent move** — watch [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w) (**3Blue1Brown**). *The visual foundation every optimizer builds on.*
2. **Tour the whole family** — watch [Optimization for Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE88eqLngkg) (**DeepBean**). *Momentum, RMSprop, AdaGrad, Adam in one coherent picture.*
3. **Feel momentum** — read [Why Momentum Really Works](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) (**Distill**). *An interactive view of how velocity accelerates and stabilizes descent.*
4. **Get every update rule** — read [An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms](https://www.ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) (**Sebastian Ruder**). *All the rules side by side, derived.*
5. **Read the sources** — [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) → [AdamW](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101). *The two papers behind today's default optimizer.*
