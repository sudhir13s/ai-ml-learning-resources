# Regularization — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Regularization](regularization.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Regularization Part 1: Ridge (L2) Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30) (**StatQuest**). *Why penalizing weights reduces variance.*
2. **See it in nets** — watch [Why Regularization Reduces Overfitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyG-7nRpsW8) (**Andrew Ng**), then toggle the regularization dropdown in [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/). *Watch a jagged boundary turn smooth.*
3. **Get the math** — read [d2l: Weight Decay](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-regression/weight-decay.html) and [Deep Learning, Ch. 7](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/regularization.html). *L2 derived as a gradient shrink + the MAP-prior and early-stopping≈L2 arguments.*
4. **Understand why it's needed** — skim [Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530) (**Zhang et al.**). *Over-parameterized nets can fit random labels — capacity doesn't prevent memorization.*
5. **Make it concrete** — add `weight_decay`, `label_smoothing`, augmentation, and early stopping to a training loop and watch the train/val gap shrink.
