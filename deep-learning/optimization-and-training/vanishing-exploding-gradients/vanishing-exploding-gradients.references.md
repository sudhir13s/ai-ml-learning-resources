# Vanishing / Exploding Gradients — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Vanishing / Exploding Gradients & Gradient Clipping](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/optimization-and-training/vanishing-exploding-gradients/vanishing-exploding-gradients)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Vanishing/Exploding Gradients (C2W1L10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhXZsFVxGKo) (**Andrew Ng**). *Why depth compounds the gradient signal up or down.*
2. **See it in code** — watch [makemore Part 3: Activations & Gradients, BatchNorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6sfmUTpUmc) (**Karpathy**). *Watch gradients die/blow up and the fixes applied live.*
3. **Get the math** — read [d2l: Numerical Stability and Initialization](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/numerical-stability-and-init.html). *The variance/Jacobian argument behind both failure modes.*
4. **Read the source** — [On the difficulty of training RNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5063) (**Pascanu et al. 2013**). *The exploding-gradient analysis and the clipping fix.*
5. **Make it concrete** — add `clip_grad_norm_` to a deep/RNN model and watch divergence stop.

**Videos**:
- [Vanishing/Exploding Gradients (C2W1L10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhXZsFVxGKo) — **DeepLearningAI (Andrew Ng)** — the clearest short explanation of why depth causes both failure modes.
- [But what is backpropagation really doing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) — **3Blue1Brown** — the most visual account of how the gradient is built layer by layer (the product this page analyzes).

- [Vanishing Gradient Problem in RNNs Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFUSJBPFsYs) — **Super Data Science** — why recurrence makes the problem acute, and what gating does.
