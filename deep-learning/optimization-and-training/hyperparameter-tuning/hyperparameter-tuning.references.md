# Hyperparameter Tuning — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Hyperparameter Tuning](hyperparameter-tuning.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Tuning Process (C2W3L01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXDByU3D1hA) (**Andrew Ng**). *Which knobs matter most and the order to tune them — learning rate first.*
2. **See the search habits** — watch [Hyperparameter Tuning in Practice (C2W3L03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKkcBPp3F1Y) (**Andrew Ng**). *Coarse-to-fine, log scales, and the panda-vs-caviar workflow.*
3. **Get the evidence** — read [Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html) (**Bergstra & Bengio, 2012**). *The classic result: random beats grid when only a few dimensions matter.*
4. **Go Bayesian** — read [Exploring Bayesian Optimization](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/) (**Distill**). *Interactive: how a surrogate + acquisition picks the next trial.*
5. **Make it concrete** — run a TPE/Hyperband sweep with [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) following [d2l Ch. 19](https://d2l.ai/chapter_hyperparameter-optimization/index.html). *Watching the search converge makes the trade-offs real.*
