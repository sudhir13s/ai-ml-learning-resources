# Loss Functions — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Loss Functions](loss-functions.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity. Every link verified live.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Cross Entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArSys5qHAU) (**StatQuest**). *Why we penalize confident-and-wrong predictions hard.*
2. **Connect to information theory** — watch [Entropy, Cross-Entropy and KL-Divergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErfnhcEV1O8) (**Aurélien Géron**). *Where the cross-entropy formula comes from, and the H(p)+KL decomposition.*
3. **Get the math** — read [Cross-entropy loss, explained](https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/) (**Raúl Gómez**). *Logits → softmax → cross-entropy, with the clean gradient.*
4. **See the MLE view** — read [d2l §4.1 (softmax + cross-entropy)](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-classification/index.html) (**Zhang et al.**). *Cross-entropy as negative log-likelihood, with runnable code.*
5. **Make it concrete** — implement MSE and cross-entropy by hand and check gradients. *Deriving $(\hat y - y)$ once makes the softmax+CE pairing permanent.*
