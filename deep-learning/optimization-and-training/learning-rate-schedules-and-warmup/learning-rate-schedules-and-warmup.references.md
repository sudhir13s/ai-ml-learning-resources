# Learning-Rate Schedules & Warmup — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Learning-Rate Schedules & Warmup](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/optimization-and-training/learning-rate-schedules-and-warmup/learning-rate-schedules-and-warmup)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer, chosen for depth on *this* topic.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the intuition** — watch [Learning Rate Decay (C2W2L09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzulmoOg2JE) (**Andrew Ng**). *Why shrinking the step late helps you settle into a minimum — the clearest 5-minute motivation.*
2. **See every option visualized** — read [Setting the learning rate of your neural network](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/nn-learning-rate/) (**Jeremy Jordan**). *LR finder, decay schedules, warm restarts — all plotted.*
3. **Get the math** — read [d2l §12.11: Learning Rate Scheduling](https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/lr-scheduler.html) (**Zhang et al.**). *Factor/polynomial/cosine schedules and warmup, with runnable code.*
4. **Read the sources** — skim [SGDR (cosine annealing)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983) and the [transformer LR schedule](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (§5.3). *The two schedules behind modern recipes.*
5. **Wire it up** — follow [PyTorch LR Scheduler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81NJgoR5RfY) (**Patrick Loeber**) and plot the LR curve. *Makes the schedule tangible in code.*
