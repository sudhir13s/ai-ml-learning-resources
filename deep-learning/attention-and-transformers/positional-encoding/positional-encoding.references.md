# Positional Encoding — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Positional Encoding](positional-encoding.md)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build intuition** — watch [Positional embeddings in transformers EXPLAINED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1biZfFLPRSY) (**AI Coffee Break with Letitia**). *Why order matters and what the encoding adds.*
2. **See the sinusoids** — watch [Position Embeddings (Visual Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dichIcUZfOw) (**Hedu AI**). *The multi-frequency sine/cosine picture, visualized.*
3. **Get the math** — read [Transformer Architecture: The Positional Encoding](https://kazemnejad.com/blog/transformer_architecture_positional_encoding/) (**Amirhossein Kazemnejad**). *The definitive derivation of the sinusoidal scheme and the rotation property.*
4. **Read the modern source** — [RoFormer: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) (**Su et al., 2021**). *The relative-position encoding behind most current LLMs.*
5. **Make it concrete** — implement sinusoidal PE following [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/). *Coding and plotting the encoding makes the frequencies click.*

**Videos**:
