# Transformer Architecture — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Transformer Architecture](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/attention-and-transformers/transformer-architecture/transformer-architecture)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the picture** — read [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) (**Jay Alammar**). *The single best visual walk-through of the whole block.*
2. **See the big idea** — watch [Transformers, the tech behind LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M) (**3Blue1Brown**). *The architecture and the residual stream, visually.*
3. **Get the math** — watch [Attention is all you need (with math)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCz4OMemCcA) (**Umar Jamil**) + read [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/). *Every equation, then line-by-line PyTorch.*
4. **Read the source** — [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (**Vaswani et al., 2017**). *The paper; read it after the intuition so every component lands.*
5. **Build it from scratch** — watch [Let's build GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) (**Andrej Karpathy**). *Coding a decoder-only transformer makes attention, masking, and the residual stream permanent.*
