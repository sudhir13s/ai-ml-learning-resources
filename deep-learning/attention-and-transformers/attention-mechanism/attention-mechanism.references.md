# Attention Mechanism — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Attention Mechanism](attention-mechanism.md)** (the concept page). External sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform, kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first. Every entry is from a primary author or a recognized deep explainer — chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Build the picture** — watch [Attention in transformers, step-by-step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlx5fFNoYc) (**3Blue1Brown**). *The clearest visualization of how Q/K/V route information.*
2. **Get the gentle intuition** — watch [Attention for Neural Networks, Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSs6nxngL6k) (**StatQuest**). *Why a model should weight some inputs more than others.*
3. **See the math, every variant** — read [Attention? Attention!](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-06-24-attention/) (**Lilian Weng**). *Each attention form with its equations.*
4. **Read the source** — [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (**Vaswani et al., 2017**). *Scaled dot-product + multi-head; the transformer.*
5. **Make it permanent** — implement it following [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/) (**Harvard NLP**). *Coding the softmax-weighted sum makes attention stop being magic.*
