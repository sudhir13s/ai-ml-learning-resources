# Efficient Attention (FlashAttention) — references and further reading

> Companion link library for **[Efficient Attention (FlashAttention)](/ai-ml/ai-ml-learning-resources/deep-learning/attention-and-transformers/efficient-attention/efficient-attention)** (the concept page). This file holds the curated links — external sources *and* internal links to related pages on this platform — kept separate so it can be reused as a standalone reference list. Grouped by type, best-first within each group. Every entry is free/open and chosen for depth on *this* topic, not popularity.

**Start here — suggested path**:
1. **Frame the problem** — watch [FlashAttention — Tri Dao | Stanford MLSys #67](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMOAud7hZg4) (**Stanford MLSys**). *The author explains IO-awareness, the memory wall, and tiling — the best single overview.*
2. **See the math** — watch [Coding FlashAttention from scratch in Triton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy8ChVd_oTM) (**Umar Jamil**). *Online softmax + tiling built line by line; the clearest derivation of the running (m, ℓ) update.*
3. **Read the source** — read [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) (**Dao et al. 2022**). *Tiling, online softmax, recomputation, and the IO-complexity theorems.*
4. **Get the one-pass softmax** — read [Online normalizer calculation for softmax](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02867) (**Milakov & Gimelshein 2018**). *The streaming softmax that is FlashAttention's mathematical heart.*
5. **Connect to long context** — read [Long-Context Methods](../../../../llms-applications-and-agents/llm-model-architectures/long-context-architectures/long-context-architectures.md). *FlashAttention is what makes ≥32K-token training and prefill practical.*

**Videos**:
- [FlashAttention — Tri Dao | Stanford MLSys #67](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMOAud7hZg4) — **Stanford MLSys** — the author's clearest full talk: IO-awareness, the memory hierarchy, tiling, and why it's exact.
- [Coding FlashAttention from scratch in Triton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy8ChVd_oTM) — **Umar Jamil** — a long, careful build of the kernel and the online-softmax derivation; the best hands-on walkthrough.
